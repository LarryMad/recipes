Authentic pork approach [ three ]
The first pork approach:
1, to buy pork ( lean meat and fat is that once a stack ) cut into 1 cm square ( thickness regardless, although aspect );
In 2, the pot put the oil ( more ), heat, add sugar ( sugar can also be ) a spoon ( can put more points ), until the paste so far ( this pot should take smoke, don't be afraid ). Cut into the meat and spices ( thick slices of ginger, a flap ( do not break) garlic, cinnamon, pepper, anise, orange peel ( not dried tangerine peel ) ), the fire and cook for three minutes, then into a deep red meat;
In 3, joined the amount of salt, soy sauce, vinegar 1/5 spoon spoon, sugar, cooking wine two spoon half spoon, spoon, soup ( chicken and half cold water can also be ) to drown the meat 3 mm, the fire to boil ( start risking smell );
In 4, small fire boil stew pan into 1.5 hours, this should be a little soup and viscous ( if the soup is too much to fire your soup, but to stand watch ), add green pepper ( not very fat that bell pepper ), can add parsley, then taste salty, and simmer for 3 minutes.
In 5, slobber drops to the pot before serving, and others do not know of one another.
