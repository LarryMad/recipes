Ingredients:
	- 1 chicken breast
	- several pieces of bacon
	- 2 carrots
	- 1 bell pepper
	- 1 avocado
	- 3 tablespoons crumbled goat cheese
	- 2 handfuls mixed greens
	- salt and pepper
	- BBQ sauce
	- friends (optional)

Directions:
	1. Fire up your grill.

	2. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper to taste, then coat with BBQ sauce.

	3. Put the chicken on the grill to cook to desired done-ness. Ideally, you want the 
	chicken to cook long enough so that the BBQ sauce thickens to a glaze.

	4. Cook bacon in a shallow pan until crispy, then pat dry.

	5. While the meats are cooking, chop the veggies (this is where friends come in 
	handy!!!). The carrots should be in small rounds. The bell pepper in small chunks.

	6. Add the chopped veggies into a large mixing bowl, along with two handfuls of 
	whatever salad greens excite your taste buds. 

	7. When the chicken is finished cooking and resting for a couple of minutes, chop 
	it into large-ish chunks and add it to the bowl.

	8. Slice the avocado in half, scoop out the insides, chop into small chunks, and 
	add them to the bowl.

	9. Add the goat cheese to the bowl.

	10. Toss the salad with a spatula. The heat from the chicken should get the avocado 
	and the cheese melty and coat the entire contents. Adjust seasoning and BBQ sauce to 
	taste.

	11. ENJOY!!!
