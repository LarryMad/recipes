Black Sesame Chocolate Chip Cookies

Ingredients
 
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 tsp. baking soda
1 tsp. salt
1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
3/4 cup granulated sugar
3/4 cup packed brown sugar
1 tsp. vanilla extract
2 large eggs
12-oz pkg. chocolate morsels
100g black sesame powder - <you can get these from a chinese grocery store>

Instructions
 
Combine flour, baking soda, salt, black sesame powder in small bowl
Beat butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar and vanilla extract in a separate bowl until creamy
Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition
Gradually beat in flour mixture
Sitr in morsels
Drop by rounded tablespoon onto ungreased baking sheets
 
Oven Temperature: 350F (remember to preheat oven a few minutes before the first batch)
Bake for 8-10 minutes (every oven is a bit different depends on where the heating source is - I would check 5 minutes into the first batch just to make sure the timing is right) - You can still eat the cookies if it's a little undercooked - some people actually like it that way since it's softer.  Can't save them if they are burnt though
