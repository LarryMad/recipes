Blueberry Coffee Cake Scones

2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
1/2 cup sugar
2 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
zest of 1/2 lemon
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 cup (1 stick) cold unsalted butter,
cut into small pieces
2 large eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/3 cup cold cultured buttermilk
1 1/2 cups fresh or thawed drained
blueberries

Crumb topping:
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/3 cup light brown sugar
1/4 tsp cinnamon
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) cold, unsalted
butter, cut into small pieces

Preheat Oven to 400 degrees. In medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, zest and salt. Cut in butter with fork or heavy duty electric mixer until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine eggs, vanilla and buttermilk; add to dry mixture and stir until sticky dough is formed. With floured hands, gently knead in blueberries.
Turn out the shaggy dough onto parchment-lined baaking sheet and pat into a 1-inch thick round about 9 inches in diameter.
To prepare crumb toppings: In small bowl, combine flour, sugar and cinnamon; work in butter with your fingers until crumbs are formed. Sprinkle over entire top of scone and press lightly to help it adhere. With knife or straightedge, divide round into 8 equal wedges but leave in single round shape. Bake in preheated oven until crusty and golden brown, 28 to 33 minutes. Use knife to separate wedges. Serve immediately or cool on rack.
