 MAKE
Heat a wok over medium-high heat. Add cooking oil and then garlic and shallots to heated oil. Saute for ~1 minute, until fragrant.
Next add chicken and saute until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.
Fold in cabbage and mushrooms and saute for another 2 to 3 minutes.
Add curry paste (start with less if it’s a paste you’ve never used before and are unsure of heat level - you can always add more), coconut milk, chicken stock, second part of fish sauce, and second part of brown sugar to wok. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 4 to 6 minutes.
While soup is cooking, pick off cilantro leaves and slice limes into wedges.
Taste and season with more fish sauce if it’s not savory enough or curry paste if it’s not fragrant enough.
Divide noodles into bowls. Ladle soup over noodles and serve with cilantro and lime wedges.
