Ingredients :
    10 large eggs 
	1 14.75-oz. can cream-style corn 
	8 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese, grated (about 2 cups), divided 
	1½ teaspoons kosher salt, divided 
	1 teaspoon black pepper, divided 
	2 tablespoons olive oil 
	1 pound shiitake mushrooms, stems removed and caps sliced 
	1 leek, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced into rings 

Directions:

Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F with racks in the middle and upper positions. Whisk eggs, corn, ½ cup cheese, ¾ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper in a medium bowl.
Step 2

Heat oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium. Add mushrooms, leek, and remaining ¾ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring often, until leek begins to brown and liquid has evaporated, 12 to 15 minutes. Transfer half of the vegetables to a medium bowl.
Step 3

Add egg mixture to skillet, tilting to distribute evenly. Cook, without stirring, until frittata begins to set around the edges, about 2 minutes. Transfer skillet to the middle rack of oven and bake until just set in the center, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven.
Step 4

Increase oven temperature to broil. Scatter remaining 1½ cups cheese and reserved vegetables over frittata, all the way to edges of skillet. Broil until cheese is melted and browned in spots, 2 to 4 minutes. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
