This is Boterkoek (Dutch Buttercake) just like my Oma (grandma) used to make. She passed away over a year ago now and I really started to crave it. I hope you like it as much as I did growing up! :)

INGREDIENTS

2/3 cup butter or 2/3 cup margarine or 2/3 cup half-and-half
1 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons almond extract
1 egg, beaten (reserve 1 tsp)
1 1/2 cups flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
sliced almonds, for garnish (optional)





DIRECTIONS
In medium bowl, mix together butter, sugar and almond extract.

Add beaten egg except for 1 teaspoon.

Sift flour and baking powder, and add to bowl, mixing with wet ingredients.
Put dough in greased 9 inch pie plate.

Mix the reserved 1 tsp of beaten egg with 1 tsp of water, and brush over dough.

Sprinkle with sliced almonds, if desired. (My Oma always used the almonds, it looks pretty and adds a nice touch!).

Bake at 350°F for 25-30 minutes or until done (firm to the touch).
This is a dense cake, but should be soft on the inside and hard on the outside, but not too hard!
