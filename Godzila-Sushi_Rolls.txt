Sushi Rolls (Godzila)

Ingredients
6 cups prepared sushi rice
9 oz (255 g, or 2 cans) cooked crab meat
6 Tbsp. Japanese mayonnaise
½ English cucumber
2 avocados
½ lemon for avocado
8 sheets nori
¼ cup white sesame seeds
Ikura (salmon roe)
Tobiko (flying fish roe)
Bamboo mat, covered with plastic wrap
Tezu (vinegared hand-dipping water): ¼ cup water + 2 tsp. rice vinegar

Instructions:
1) Crab meat: combine the crab meat with Japanese mayonnaise and mix together.
2) Cucumber: Peel and remove seeds. Cut into thin long strips, same length as the nori sheet.
3) Avocado: Peel, pit, and cut into ¼" (0.5 cm) thick slices (See How To Cut Avocado). Squeeze the lemon juice over the avocado to prevent browning.
4) Nori: Cut off ⅓ and use ⅔ sheet of nori.
