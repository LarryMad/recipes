Ingredients:
1/4 yellow onion, thinly sliced
2 green onions, chopped, dark green parts separated from white and light green parts
1/3 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons white sugar
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1/4 teaspoon Korean red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon minced fresh ginger
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 1/2 pounds beef sirloin steak, cut very thin using kitchen shears
1 teaspoon honey, or to taste

Directions:
1. Combine yellow onion, white and light green parts of green onions, soy sauce, sugar, sesame seeds,
garlic, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, ginger, and black pepper in a bowl until marinade is well mixed.
Add steak slices to marinade; cover and refrigerate, 1 hour to 1 day.
