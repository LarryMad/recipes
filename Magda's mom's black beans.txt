mom's recipe for black beans. finally got her cuban soup right, beans mysteriously delicious 1st try. sister doesnt trust me,"Wash them ...in water."
One bag of black beans.  Wash them in water really well--they usually have dirt.  On your crock pot soak them overnight in about 4 cups of water.  Check that all the water has not been absorbed after a few hours.  Add one tablespoon of sugar and two bay leaves to that water.   In the morning turn the crockpot on and let the beans begin to cook.  Depending on the amount of water that is left from the soaking, you add enough water to have the pot covered a little less than halfway with water. This is going to take ,I estimate ,5 to 6 hours. The beans are ready when you can smash one with a fork.  In a separate pot--frying pan is fine, olive oil, add one chopped sweet onion, one green pepper, four to five garlic cloves chopped, let all of these ingredients cook in the oil on medium heat.  Stir it every two minutes.  Cook for five minutes lower the heat if it is cooking too fast.  Add two teaspoons of cumin, one teaspoon of paprika, garlic salt, one chicken bullion, one can of tomato sauce, (NO- make it fresh tomatoes, magda)  one cup of Edmundo cooking wine (i left you a bottle) or another brand--golden or white cooking wine-/ if Americans up there dont have it. Let the sauce cook very low heat for about 45 minutes.  It should boil but not too briskly or it will burn.  Take some of the black beans out--like five to ten tablespoons and smash them.  Put those smashed beans back into the crockpot.  That will thicken the beans.  Add the sofrito into the beans.   At the very end add one capful of wine vinegar.  Pray you can eat it.
