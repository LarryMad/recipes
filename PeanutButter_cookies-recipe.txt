Ingredients

1?2 cup butter
1?2 cup peanut butter
1?2 cup sugar
1?2 cup brown sugar
1 egg
1?2 teaspoon vanilla
1 1?4 cups sifted flour
3?4 teaspoon baking soda
1?4 teaspoon salt

DIRECTIONS

Preheat oven to 375?F.
Mix first six ingredients.
Add the rest of the ingredients.
Mix well.
Roll into balls and press down with a fork dipped in sugar or flour.
Bake for 10-12 minutes on ungreased cookie sheet (I usually grease my cookie sheet anyway). Ovens vary so your baking time may be less. Just keep an eye on them.
