Points to remember

    Make sure your eggs are really fresh.
    Add a small dash of vinegar to a pan of steadily simmering water.
    Crack eggs individually into a ramekin or cup.
    Create a gentle whirlpool in the water to help the egg white wrap around the yolk.
    Slowly tip the egg into the water, white first.
