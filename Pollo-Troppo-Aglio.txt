Pollo Troppo Aglio = too much garlic chicken

(name of my crock-pot roasted chicken)

Ingredients:

  * A whole chicken (4-5lbs-ish).
  * Brine Solution: 1/4 cup sugar + 1/4 cup salt per quart of water.
  * Two large onions (I like vidalia or red).
  * Whatever spices sound good in the pantry (but usually includes black pepper, chili powder, oregano, basil and parsley).  No extra salt needed: the bird is brined prior to cooking.
  *
    * I usually add ground red pepper, cumin, thyme and bay leaves too.
    * Hold the cumin and add your favorite garam masala, if you have it.

  * Minced garlic (start with one whole head of garlic, which is probably too much, then add more to taste)
  *
    * If you want get fancy with the garlic, slice it thin, instead of mincing it: so you can use it to "tile" the skin of the bird, as well as make the occasional incision in the skin and place some under it.


Steps:

  1. Brine the chicken in the fridge for min 24 hrs; though I usually do 48 hrs.
  2. Line bottom of a large crock-pot with one of the onions peeled and sliced into thick-ish pieces (about 1/4"), to prevent bird from sticking to pot.
  3. Cram the other whole peeled onion up where the sun don't shine (of the poultry, of course).
  4. Dump a tablespoon of the minced garlic into the aforementioned cavity.
  5. Season the breast side of the bird first.
  6. Flip the boid over and place it in the crock-pot, breast-side down (a lot of the fat is in the back of the bird: so as it cooks, the rendered fat bastes the chicken and keeps the breast tender).
  7. Season bottom of bird.
  8. Liberally spread minced garlic over visible parts of bird.
  9. Cover and cook on low for six hours.
  10. During the last two hours of cooking, it might be difficult to be in the house -- THE SMELL!  :-)
  11. Nom!
