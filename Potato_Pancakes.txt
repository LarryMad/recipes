POTATO PANCAKES RECIPE 
1.  Using a food processor or hand shredder, grate potatoes 
	and onion using the finest grader.  The finer the potatoes 
	are grated, the better because it is easier to cook.  
	If you grate the potatoes in larger chunks, you will just
	have to cook longer and use a little bit more oil for taste.
2.  Squeeze potatoes and onions with hands to remove excess liquid.  
3.  Put grated potatoes and onion in a large bowl and mix with eggs,
	garlic, flour, marjoram, salt, and pepper.
4.  Heat oil in large frying pan until almost smoking.  
	Carefully put a large spoonful of the potato mixture into 
	the pan and flatten with a fork.  Repeat until you have 3-4 pancakes 
	in the pan. Fry each pancake until it is golden brown on both sides.  
	Remove with spatula and drain on a paper towel.
5.  Serve potato pancakes warm with topping of choice.  If using the 
	sour cream topping, simply mix all ingredients together and serve 
	on the side.
