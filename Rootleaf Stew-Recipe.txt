Ingredients

-8 oz mushrooms, sliced
-2 Tbs. cooking oil
-1 Tbs. garlic, finely minced
-1 Tbs. freshly grated ginger root
-1/2 tsp. each ground cumin, turmeric, cinnamon
-2 cups chopped roots, such as potato, carrot, parsnip, etc.
-2 cups vegetable broth
-several handfuls collard greens, torn small

Heat half the oil in a saucepan over medium heat and cook the mushrooms for several minutes, until they have released their juices. Move the mushrooms to a bowl and set aside.
Add the rest of the oil, followed by the ginger and ground spices, stirring for about 30 seconds until they are fragrant. Pour in the vegetable broth, followed by the root vegetables. Add water to just cover the roots, and simmer until they are soft, around 10-15 minutes, depending on their size. Add the mushrooms back in, followed by the collard greens. Cook for another minute or two, then scoop into serving bowls.
