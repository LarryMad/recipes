Ingredients
1.2kg King Edward potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
750g Waitrose Frozen Smoked Haddock Fillets, thawed, cut into 4 equal-sized pieces
75g unsalted butter
400ml whole milk
1 bunch salad onions, chopped
2 tsp wholegrain mustard
1-2 tbsp Waitrose Creamed Horseradish
4 medium eggs
4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1‚ÅÑ2 x 25g pack chives, snipped


Method
Cook the potatoes in boiling salted water for 20-25 minutes, or until tender. Meanwhile, place the haddock in a frying pan. Add a knob of the butter, some black pepper and the milk. Bring to the boil, and simmer, covered, for 8-10 minutes, or until just cooked. Keep warm.
Place the salad onions in a small pan with 6 tbsp of the cooking milk from the haddock and bring to the boil. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until softened. When the potatoes are cooked, drain and mash them with the remaining butter, the softened salad onions, 1 tsp of the mustard and horseradish to taste. Meanwhile, poach the eggs. Bring a pan of slightly salted water to the boil, stir with a spoon to create a whirlpool, then crack an egg into the centre. Simmer for 3 minutes, then remove with a slotted spoon. Set aside and repeat with the remaining eggs.
Mix the remaining mustard with the olive oil and chives, then season. Place a heaped spoonful of mash onto 4 warmed plates. Top each with a piece of haddock, then a poached egg. Finally, drizzle the mustard oil over and serve immediately.


Cook's tip
To get ahead, poach the eggs an hour or two in advance, keep them in a bowl of iced water, then slip them back into boiling water for 1-2 minutes to reheat when ready to serve.
