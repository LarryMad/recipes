Smoked pork shoulder. 

1) Dry Rub
	1/4 c 	kosher salt
	1/4 c 	Paprika
	1/4 c	brown sugar
	2 Tbls	ground black pepper
	2 tsp	garlic power
	2 tsp	onion powder
	1 tsp 	celery seeds
	1 tsp	cumin
	1 tsp	ground red pepper
	1 tsp	cayenne pepper
	1 tsp 	chili powder

	Mix all ingrdients in a bowl and wisk until consistant. If brown sugar has clumps then break them up with your fingers. 

2) Prepare pork
	Take a 6-8 lb pork shoulder. Rinse and pat dry. The fat cap should be roughly 1/8" thick. If it is thicker you may want to trim it down. 
	Generously apply dry rub to the pork. Be sure to vigerously rub the mix into the flesh. Once completely covered, wrap tightly in plastic wrap and place in a fidge over night. 

3) Smoking. 
	Take the pork out of the fridge about 1 hour before placing it into the smoker. Light your smoker and bring it up to 225-250 degrees (farenheight). You will want to keep the smoker in this temperature range for the duration of smoking. One to temperature place pork on rack fat cap up. Total smoke time will be approximately 1hr per pound.

4) Tending the smoker. 
	You will need a mop sauce in a spray bottle. I suggest 3/4c apple cider vineger and 1/4c oil. Starting about 1 hour into the smoke spray the mop onto the pork shoulder once every 45 minutes. 

Tips:
	Keep the smoker closed as much as possible. 
	When opening hte smoker work fast and close it quickly 
	Approximately 2 hours before the end of the cook remove the pork and wrap it tightly in a double layer of foil before placing it back in the smoker. 
	After the cook is complete place the foil wrapped pork in a cooler or a warm (but off) oven for about an hour to allow it to sweat. 

5) Eat awesome pork.
