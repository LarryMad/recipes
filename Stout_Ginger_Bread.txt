1 1/2 tsp Baking Powder
2 Tbs ground ginger
1 tsp ground cinammon

* A note about spices — use the freshest spices available; freshness really does make a difference.   
Spices from the grocery store work fine, but if you have a local spice purveyor that will provide 
small amounts try going there.  That way, you won’t have to purchase more than you need and you 
won’t have excess spice aging in your kitchen.  (Here in Milwaukee we have the Spice House on 
Old World Third St., Outpost, and Penzy’s Spices).

Cooking Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  
   Generously butter a 10″ cake pan and dust with flour,  
   knocking out excess flour.

2. Bring stout and molasses to a boil in a large saucepan and remove from heat.  
   Whisk in baking soda and then cool to room temperature.

3. Sift together flour, baking powder and spices in a large bowl.  
   Whisk together eggs and sugars.  
   Whisk in oil, then molasses mixture.  
   Add to flour mixture and whisk until just combined.

4. Pour batter into cake pan.  
   Bake in the middle of the oven until a toothpick comes out with just a few moist crumbs adhering, about 40 minutes.  
   Cool cake in pan on rack for 5 minutes.  
   Turn out onto a rack and cool completely.  
   Serve w/ ice cream or fresh whipped cream and Sprecher Imperial Stout or Sprecher Generation Porter.
