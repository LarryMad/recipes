Ingredients:
1 banana
6 to 8 strawberries
1/4 cup silken tofu
1/4 raw cashews
1 to 2 tablespoons non-dairy milk
1 date, pitted
1/2 cup ice cubes

Directions:
1. Chop two or three strawberries into small pieces. Set aside.
2. Add all ingredients to a blender except the milk and chopped strawberries. Once the blender gets going, add milk a little at a time until ingredients are able to process smoothly. HINT: Use as little milk as possible to keep the soft serve as thick as possible.
3. Pour soft serve into a serving dish and stir in chopped strawberries.
