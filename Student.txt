CHICKEN FAJITAS


Ingredients
•	4 large flour tortilla wraps
•	2 tsp oil

ULTIMATE SALMON FISH CAKE RECIPE

Peel and roughly chop 450g (1lb) floury potatoes and cook in boiling salted water for 15min until tender, adding 250g (9oz) salmon fillets to the pan for the last 5min of cooking time. Lift the salmon out on to a plate lined with kitchen paper, then drain the potatoes and leave to steam dry for 5min. Return potatoes to the empty pan and mash until smooth.

Mix in 1tbsp freshly chopped dill, 1tbsp chopped capers, the grated zest of 1 lemon and plenty of seasoning. Flake in the salmon in large pieces (discard skin). Shape mixture into four equal-sized patties.

Into separate lipped bowls, put some plain flour, 1 lightly beaten medium egg and 75g (3oz) dried breadcrumbs. In turn, dip each cake in the flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs to coat (shake off excess as you dip).

Heat a thin layer of sunflower oil in a large frying pan over medium heat and fry the cakes for 6-8min, turning midway through, or until nicely golden. Serve with lemon wedges and a green salad.

STORECUPBOARD OMELETTE

Ingredients
•	A drizzle of olive oil or knob of butter
•	1 large onion, finely chopped
•	225 g (8oz) cooked new potatoes, sliced - leftovers are ideal
•	125 g (4oz) frozen petit pois, thawed
•	6 eggs, beaten
•	150 g pack soft goat's cheese, sliced
Method
1.	Heat the oil or butter in a 25.5cm (10in) non-stick ovenproof frying pan and fry the onion for 6-8min until golden. Add potatoes and petit pois and cook, stirring, for 2-3min. Preheat the grill.
2.	Spread mixture over the pan base and pour in beaten egg. Tilt the pan to coat the base with egg. Leave omelette to cook un-disturbed for 2-3min, then top with cheese.
3.	Put the pan under a hot grill for 1-2min or until the egg is just set (no longer, or it will turn rubbery) and the cheese starts to turn golden. Season and serve immediately with a green salad.
4.	Easy ways to jazz it up: 1 Use 100g (3½oz) sundried tomatoes instead of the new potatoes. 2 Throw in a handful of halved pitted black olives as you pour the egg into the pan. 3 Use any melting cheese, such as grated Cheddar, instead of goat's cheese.

FRITTATA IN A FLASH

Ingredients

Pour in the egg mixture and swirl the spinach lightly through with a wooden spoon. Cook for 2-3min so the base of the frittata has a chance to set, then transfer to the oven and cook for 15-20min until just firm and golden. Cut into wedges and serve with a crisp green salad
