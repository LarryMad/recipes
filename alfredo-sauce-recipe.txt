Makes about 4 servings - depends on amount of sauce folks want.
2 cups half/half and/or heavy whipping cream
1/4 cup butter (or something similar)
1/4 cup paremsan cheese (or best available cheese - shredded or
 finely chopped)
1 tablespoon black pepper
2 tablespoons EVOO (olive oil for flavor - OPTIONAL)
1/2 tablespoon powdered sugar (good for kids - OPTIONAL)
1/2 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes (adjust for amount of desired 'kick')
1/4 cup Fresh basil and/or parsley - OPTIONAL

Just start with half/half, boil it, turn heat down to low and stir and
add ingredients, slowly stirring and cover pot off an on for at least
15 minutes for up to 2 hours (or more - flavor sets in better, but don't
want it to get too dry).
