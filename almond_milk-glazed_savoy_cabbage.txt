Ingredients
600g savoy cabbage
150ml unsweetened almond milk
3 tablespoons light olive oil
30g flaked almonds, toasted
4 sprigs tarragon, leaves roughly chopped
Total time required   10 mins
Cooking time: 10 mins
Instructions
Separate the cabbage leaves, halving and removing the tough rib in the centre of the leaf as you go.
Place a large saucepan on a hob at a high temperature. Add the olive oil and wait for thirty seconds for it to warm up. Add the cabbage leaves and cook for 4 mins, pushing around occasionally (this will be easiest with tongs), until the majority of the leaves appear vibrant in colour, glossy and partially wilted.
Pour in the almond milk – it should bubble up immediately if your pan is at the right temperature‚ then add the tarragon, toasted almonds and a good pinch of sea salt and lots and lots of black pepper.
Cook for 45-60 secs more, moving all the time, and decant into a serving bowl before the cabbage turns translucent and soggy.
