Ingredients
1 package (17-1/2 ounces) sugar cookie mix
1-1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon, divided
3/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 cup cold butter, cubed
4 large apples, peeled and finely chopped (about 6 cups)
1/4 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup all-purpose flour, divided
1/4 cup raisins
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon maple syrup

Directions
Preheat oven to 350°. In a large bowl, whisk cookie mix, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves; cut in butter until crumbly. Reserve 1 cup for topping; press remaining onto bottom and up sides of an ungreased 9-in. tart pan. Bake 8-10 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove to a wire rack.
Meanwhile, in a large saucepan, combine apples and brown sugar. Cook and stir over medium heat 7-9 minutes or until apples are tender and brown sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat; stir in 1/4 cup flour, raisins and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon.
Increase oven setting to 400°. Pour apple mixture into crust. Add remaining flour to reserved topping and sprinkle over apples. Bake 20-22 minutes longer or until filling is bubbly and topping is golden brown. Cool on a wire rack at least 20 minutes.
In a small bowl, beat cream until it begins to thicken. Add syrup and remaining cinnamon; beat until soft peaks form. Serve tart warm or at room temperature with whipped cream. Yield: 12 servings (1 cup whipped cream).
