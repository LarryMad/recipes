Pillsbury crusts-it's easier  1 tsp. flour sprinkled on

Instructions:
Alternate apples, sugar, cinnamon, lemon juice in layers.
Add more lemon juice if you like your pie tart.  Put pat of
Butter on top of final layer. Put second crust on top. Bake
at 450 for 15 min. - then 350 45-50 min.  I put tin foil
around the crust edges, so that the edges don't burn.
