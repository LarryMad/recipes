**Chili**

* 1 lb of mince (either beef, turkey, chicken, or even soy)
* Paprika
* Cumin
* Chili powder
* Garlic salt
* Salt & Pepper
* 1-3 cloves of garlic, pressed
* 1 Onion, chopped
* 3 Bell peppers (red, green, or yellow, or any mixture), chopped
* 1 Can of kidney beans (or soak your own, I'm lazy)
* Tomato puree or 1 jar of salsa

1. Add Salt & Pepper to the mince to taste
2. Brown the mince with garlic salt and drain
3. Return mince to pan, add beans and Tomato puree or salsa
4. Add seasoning
  * I have a mixture of spices that I don't measure but instead use as a ratio of 1:1:3 (Paprika:Cumin:Chili powder)
5. Add remaining veggies and allow to simmer
6. Serve in a bowl with cheese and sour cream. I also use Doritos or Fritos.
