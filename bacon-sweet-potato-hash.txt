2 large sweet potatoes peeled and shredded
4 pieces of bacon chopped
1/2 onion diced

Saute bacon and onions in large skillet over medium heat until onions brown and bacon is starting to crisp

Place shredded sweet potatoes into a large bowl.

Pour bacon & onions into the bowl of sweet potatoes ensuring all the grease from the skillet is scraped into the bowl.

Season with salt & pepper.

Mix well to coat the sweet potato shreds with bacon grease.

Place 1-2 cups of the mixture back into the skillet and flip frequently with a stiff spatula to ensure sweet potatoes do not burn or stick to the bottom of the skillet.

Remove when browned to your satisfaction and enjoy!
