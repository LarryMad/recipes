Ingredients

1 larger sized potato
grated cheese
jar of sweet and hot chutney
olive oil (optional)

Preheat the oven to 180 - 200 deg C. Pierce the potato to around 2cm depth in several places around it to prevent the skin trapping expanding steam and causing a messy explosion. Optionally coat potato in olive oil. Bake for about 40 - 60 minutes. Remove, slice once and spoon in the chutney, sprinkle cheese over the top.
