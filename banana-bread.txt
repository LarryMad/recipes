3 medium ripe bananas (~1.5 cups or 337 g)
1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
1 egg (or sub 1 chia or flax egg – see notes)
3 Tbsp (45 ml) grape seed or coconut oil, melted
1/4 cup (50 g) organic cane sugar
1/4 cup packed (55 g) organic brown sugar
2-3 Tbsp (63-84 g) honey, depending on ripeness of bananas (or sub maple syrup)
3.5 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp sea salt
1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
3/4 cup (180 ml) unsweetened almond or dairy milk
1 1/4 cup (137 g) almond meal
1 1/4 cup (200 g) gluten free flour blend
1 1/4 cup (112 g) gluten free oats

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a 9x5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper or spray with nonstick spray.
2. Mash banana in a large bowl. Add all ingredients through almond milk and whisk vigorously to combine. Last add almond meal, gluten free flour blend and oats and stir.
3. Bake for 1 hour – 1 hour 15 minutes. When ready, it should feel firm and be crackly and golden brown on top.
4. Let cool completely before cutting or it will be too tender to hold form.
5. Serve with butter and honey or as is. Store leftovers in a covered container for up to a few days. Slice and freeze for longer term storage.
