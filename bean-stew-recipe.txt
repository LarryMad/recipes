This is the recipe for a personal version of the Asturian stew.

Ingredients:

- About 250 g of beans
- Your choice of meat: chorizo, rice blood sausage and lard is recommended
- An onion
- One or two peppers, depending on the size
- Half a garlic / some cloves
- Olive oil
- Paprika, salt, pepper and albahaca if available. Feel free to change.

Instructions:

- Leave the beans overnight in a bowl filled with water.
- Change the water and put the beans in a pressure cooker. Make sure that the
  water is about twice the volume of the beans, and that there's enough space
	in the cooker.
- Add the meats, vegetables and the spices. 
- Cook in a low fire for about 4 hours. 
- Take out the garlic and blend the peppers and garlic.
- Mix everything up and serve.
