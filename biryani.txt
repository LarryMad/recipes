Hyderabadi Vegetable Biryani Recipe â€“ This is the most popular veg biryani recipe in the blog, tried and tested by many readers. Another popular vegetable biryani recipe on the blog is restaurant style vegetable dum biryani.

One of my favorite food is the vegetable biryani. My mom makes the best veg biryanis and I have seen her many times cooking biryani with a lot of love and care. You really have to cook the biryani with a lot of love and care. There should be no hurry and cooking a biryani takes up some time. Yet it is worth it. It is one of the most grand, noble and delectable recipe from India.

The biryanis which I have seen my mom making at home have always been cooked on dum. Ideally biryanis are cooked on dum. But I have seen and read pressure cooked biryani recipes too. I did try to make a pressure cooked biryanis, but they always tasted to me like pulao.
