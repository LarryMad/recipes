Ingredients:
2 tblsp olive oil
1 onion
Pinch salt
2 cloves garlic
500 g beef mince
1 x 140 g tub of triple concentrate tomato paste
1 can diced tomatoes
250 ml red wine
250 ml chicken stock
1 tsp dried mixed herbs
1 tsp dried basil
Pepper to taste

Method:
Chop onion
Preheat pan on high
Fry onion in olive oil until softened
Add garlic and fry for a minute
Add beef, making sure it is free of lumps and fry until browned
Add dried herbs
Add tomato paste and cook for a minute or so to 'cook it in'
Add can tomatoes, red wine, chicken stock, pepper to taste
Stir, bring to the boil and turn down to a simmer and cook uncovered (or a porous splatter guard) for 45 minutes until much of the moisture has disappeared. This sauce is meant to be quite solid, with just enough moisture to coat the pasta.

Serve with spaghetti or linguine.
