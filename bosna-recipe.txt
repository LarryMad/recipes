Ingredients:

- 4 lbs of the fat cap side of a pork butt
- 1 lb veal
- 3 tbsp kosher salt, erring toward the scant side
- 2 tsp white pepper
- 2 tsp lemon zest
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp marjoram
- 1 tsp nutmeg
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup heavy cream

Directions:
 1. dice the meat into 1/2-3/4″ cubes and combine it with the spices a day ahead of time,
    leaving it in the refrigerator overnight. That mixture gets spread out onto a cookie sheet
    and frozen for about an hour until it’s nice and firm but not frozen solid. That way,
    you get a nice clean grind.
 
 2. the ground meat gets combined with the eggs and heavy cream and mixed to create a tacky
    sausage texture before being stuffed into hog casings
 
 3. For the sandwich, I was going to use the Turano French Rolls that are a standard at
    Italian Beef joints (and even at Christkindlmarket–where, incidentally, you can also get
    a currywurst that is kissing cousins with the Bosna but not close enough for this post) and
    a spicy brown mustard, but I wasn’t sure I even had curry powder.
