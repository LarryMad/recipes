Place ginger and garlic in the bowl of a small food processor and process until a paste forms. Transfer to a large bowl, add yoghurt, juice, turmeric, ground chilli, garam masala, green chillies, Â½ tsp salt and half the coriander and mint, mixing well to combine. Add chicken, turning to coat in marinade, then cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place saffron in a bowl with 2 tbsp warm water and set aside to infuse for the same amount of time.

Heat ghee and oil in a large, non-stick frying pan with a tight-fitting lid over high heat. Add onions and cook, stirring, for 15 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from pan, drain on paper towel and set aside. Add almonds to same pan and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until golden. Remove from pan, drain on paper towel and set aside.

Remove all but 1 tbsp oil mixture from pan and reserve. Allow excess marinade to drip off chicken, then add to pan and reduce heat to low.

Place a large saucepan of cold water over high heat. Add bay leaves, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom and caraway seeds. Drain rice, then add to pan and bring to the boil. As soon as rice starts to boil, strain out half the rice and evenly spread over chicken. Drizzle over some of the reserved cooking oil, top with half the fried onions and half the fried almonds, then sprinkle over remaining coriander and mint. Continue cooking biryani over low heat, and continue boiling remaining rice for a further 2 minutes or until tender.

Drain remaining rice, then place on top of biryani. Top with the remaining fried almonds. Drizzle over saffron-infused water, cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook for a further 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and rice is tender. Top with remaining fried onions and serve sprinkled with coriander and mint.
