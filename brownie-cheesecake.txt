 	1 cup whole wheat flour  

 	1/2 tsp. salt  

 	3 pkg. (8 oz. each) PHILADELPHIA LIGHT Cream Cheese, softened 

 	1/2 cup BREAKSTONE'S or KNUDSEN Sour Cream

Steps:

	1. Preheat oven to 325Â°F. Microwave chocolate and margarine in large microwaveable bowl on HIGH 2 
	min. or until margarine is melted. Stir until chocolate is completely melted. Add 1-1/2 cups of the
	sugar; mix well.

	Add milk and 1 tsp. of the vanilla; mix well. Combine flour and salt. Gradually add to chocolate 
	mixture, mixing after each addition just until blended. Spread evenly into greased and floured 9-
	inch springform pan. Bake 25 min.

	electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. Add sour cream; mix well. Add remaining 3 
	eggs, one at a time, mixing on low speed after each addition just until blended. Pour over 
	brownie layer in pan (Filling will come almost to top of pan.)

	4. Bake 55 min. to 1 hour or until center is almost set. Run knife or metal spatula around rim
