    3/4 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder
    3/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
    1/2 tsp sea salt
    1/2 tsp baking powder
    1/4 cup neutral canola or other neutral oil
    2 tbsp non-dairy milk
    2 tsp pure vanilla extract


Sift together the cocoa, flour, salt and baking powder in a medium bowl. Note: Make sure to use Dutch-process cocoa powder for this recipe.

Sift the cocoa mixture over the meringue in the mixing bowl. Pour the oil, non-dairy milk and vanilla directly over the cocoa mixture and, using a rubber spatula, fold the mixture together until a pourable batter forms without any obvious air bubbles.

Spoon the batter into the prepared pan. Transfer to the preheated oven and bake for approximately 40 minutes or until a tester inserted into the middle comes out clean or with only a few moist crumbs attached. Do not over-bake. Note: If using a glass baking dish the baking time maybe a bit longer.

Remove from the oven and immediately run a knife around the edges of the pan. Grasping the overhanging parchment paper, lift the brownies to a wire rack to cool cool completely before cutting and serving.
