Ingredients Nutrition
1 egg.
1 teaspoon mustard (regular or Dijon)
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce.
1 small onion, finely grated.
1 clove garlic, minced.
1⁄2 teaspoon salt.
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper.

DIRECTIONS

Lightly oil grill& heat BBQ to medium.
Whisk egg in a bowl& add next 6 ingredients.
Add any of the “stir-ins” that appeal to you.
Crumble in beef& using your hands or a fork, gently mix together.
Handle the meat as little as possible – the more you work it, the tougher it gets.
Gently shape (don’t firmly press) mixture into burgers about ¾ inch thick.
Using your thumb, make a shallow depression in the centre of each burger to prevent puffing up during cooking.
Place burgers on the grill, close lid& BBQ until NO LONGER PINK INSIDE, turning once, about 6 – 8 minutes per side.
An instant read thermometer should read 160F.
Don't abuse your burgers by pressing with a spatula, pricking with a fork or turning frequently as precious juices will be lost!
Tuck into a warm crusty bun& add your favourite toppings.
