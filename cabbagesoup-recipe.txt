This is a recipe for cabbage soup.

The amounts are variable.

Take roughly the same amount of chopped carrots onions and celery and
cook them with some garlic in a couple spoonfulls of butter. 

Then add a cabbage, cored and chopped to bite size
Add as many potatos as you like, then enough water to just barely cover
the stuff in the pot.

Add a couple of chicken broth cubes.  If you would like this to be
vegetarian, use vegetarian chicken broth.  

Add a bay leaf, some pepper, some paprika, and any other herbs & spices
you like.

Cook on medium for a few hours, or on high until it's done how you like.
This can also be all thrown into a crock pot and ignored all day.  The
soup is able to be eaten when all the ingredients are soft, but if you
let it cook on medium-low for longer, it will taste better.  

If you are not vegetarian, start with cut up bacon, cook that and then
add the vegetables into the fat for a bacon-cabbage soup.  Everything
is better with bacon.
