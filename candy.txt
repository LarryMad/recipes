      Title: Almond Nougat
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  2
 
  1 1/2 c  Light corn syrup
      2 c  Sugar
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/4 c  Water
      2    Egg whites
    1/2 ts Almond extract
           Red or green food coloring
    1/4 c  Soft butter or margarine
      1 c  Toasted chopped almonds
    1/4 c  Chopped candied cherries
 
  DIRECTIONS: Mix first 4 ingredients in heavy saucepan. Cook, stirring,
  until sugar is dissolved. Cook, without stirring, until a small amount of
  the mixture dropped in cold water forms a hard ball (250-F). Beat egg
  whites until stiff, but not dry, in large bowl of electric mixer. Gradually
  beat in about one fourth (not more) of the syrup, and continue beating
  until mixture holds its shape. Cook remaining syrup until a small amount of
  mixture separates into hard and brittle threads when dropped in cold water
  (300-F). Gradually beat into first mixture, and continue beating until the
  mixture begins to hold its shape. Add flavoring and food coloring to tint a
  delicate shade. Beat in butter; continue beating until very thick and
  satiny. Stir in nuts and cherries. Press into a buttered 8x8x2" pan,
  smoothing top. Let stand until firm. Turn out of pan, and cut in 1 1/2" by
  1" pieces. Wrap each piece individually in waxed paper. For best flavor,
  store several days in a cool place before serving.

      2 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Whole almonds
      1 lg Package chocolate chips
    1/2 c  Walnuts ground in a blender
 
  Melt butter over high heat.  Add sugar, stirring until it foams up well.
  Continue over high heat, adding almonds.  Continue to cook, stirring
  continually until mixture is color of mahogany and sugar is all melted.
  (Take it off the heat for a moment if it starts to smoke.)
  
  Stir as you take it off the heat permanently and pour quickly onto your
  biggest flat pan with sides.  Tilt to spread evenly.  After 5 minutes, pour
  on chocolate chips. When they have melted a bit, spread them over the top
  of the hot mixture with a rubber scraper. Scatter ground walnuts over the
  top, shaking to distribute evenly.
  
  Candy is thoroughly cooled when the chocolate is dull looking. (Cool at
  least three hours at room temperature.) Break into pieces and it's ready to
  eat.

   Servings:  6
 
      1 c  Pecans, chopped (we use
           -chopped almonds on some
           -batches)
    3/4 c  Brown sugar (packed)
    1/2 c  Butter or margarine (butter
           -makes it richer)
    1/2 pk (6 oz size) semisweet
           -chocolate chips. (1/2 cup)
 
  Almond Rocca: This is not for Almond Roca, yet it is close enough and it is
  real easy. In fact my 14 year old daughter has been making it by herself at
  christmas for the past 4 years. Hope this will meet your needs. It comes
  from the Betty Crocker cookbook, so you may have it on hand already.
  
  Toffee: Butter square pan, 9x9x2 inches. Spread chopped nuts in pan. Heat
  sugar and butter to boiling, stirring constantly. Boil over medium heat,
  stirring constantly, 7 minutes (watch it real close the last minute or
  two).  Immediately spread mixture evenly over nuts in pan. Sprinkle
  chocolate pieces over hot mixture; place a baking sheet over pan so
  contained heat will melt chocolate.  Spread melted chocolate over canndy.
  While hot, cut into 1 1/2 inch squares.  chill until firm.
  
  Now for the changes we use.
  
  When we are going to be giving this as a gift, we melt another 1/2 cup of
  chocolate in the microwave.  Use an 7x7x2 pan (or smaller than the 9x9x2).
  Spread the melted chocolate on top of the buttered pan that is covered with
  the nuts.  After the chocolate is spread on top, sprinkle more nuts on top,
  while chocolate is still warm. Then cut into small sizes. After the candy
  is set, remove from the pan and wrap individually with desert foil. I get
  mine at the bakery supply, or a craft shop.

  2 1/2 lb Dry Candy Fondant
      1 c  Butter

MMMMM-------------------------------ADD------------------------------------
    1/2 c  Whipping cream
 
  Mix first 2 ingred. & let set overnight <or for several hours> tightly
  covered. Add cream & whip with heavy duty mixer or by hand. Divide dough
  into separate bowls. <I divide into 3>. Makes nice batch of each. For each
  bowl, add whatever color/flavor, etc you like. Below are some ideas:
  Vanilla cremes: add vanilla ****to taste. Chocolate cremes: add melted dark
  chocolate to taste. Mint center: add drops of peppermint oil & pink
  coloring. Black Walnut center: add drops black walnut oil & bl walnuts.
  Peanutbutter cremes: add smooth or crunchy peanut butter. Pineapple cremes:
  add drops pineapple oil, chopped candied pineapple & chopped pecans. Jelly:
  add fruit "flavored" jelly into candy mold with matching flavored oil
  w/creme center. Nut center: wrap creme center mix around a nut meat as
  filling; dip in white/tinted, or milk chocolate. Chocolate covered cherries
  <cream type:> wrap creme center  mix around a well-drained marachino
  cherry...be sure the cherry is SEALED in the dough, chill & dip in choc.*
  Be sure to dip as soon as removing from fridge. The acid in the cherry
  causes it to start cordialing <liquifying> quickly. Will liquify some, but
  some will remain "creamy" because of the butter. Coconut cremes: add
  maccaroon coconut & drops or coconut oil For any dipped cremes: Form 1"
  balls, let crust over & dip in compound coating chocolate. This is also
  called "dipping chocolate." I prefer the brand "Merckens." It seems to take
  more abuse/ reheating, or getting too hot, etc. Dolores McCann, Hamilton

 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  6
 
      2 c  White Sugar, Granulated
    1/2 c  Light Corn Syrup
    1/2 c  Water
      1 pn Salt
      2 lg Egg Whites
      1 ts Vanilla Extract
      1 c  Nuts, Chopped *
 
  * Chopped cherries or chopped orange peels may be used in place of chopped
  nuts.
  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE:  To prewarm a candy thermometer, simply place it in a sauce pan of
  cold water and bring it to a boil.  Let it simmer until you need the
  thermometer. STEP 1: Prewarm the thermometer; separate the eggs allowing
  the whites to come to room temperature in a large bowl of an electric
  mixer.  (Return the egg yolks to the refrigerator covering with plastic
  wrap or water for another recipe.) Fill a glass with ice cubes and water.
  To make dropped divinities, you will need 2 cookie sheets, topped with
  greased wax paper. For squares, use a greased and wax paper-lined 8 X
  8-inch pan.  Measure the sugar, corn syrup, ice water and salt and dump
  into a heavy 2-quart saucepan with a tight fitting lid. STEP 2: Dissolve
  the sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon over low heat. Syrup
  will become clear, gritty sounds will cease, and the spoon will glide
  smoothly over the bottom of the pan. Increase the heat to medium and bring
  to a boil. STEP 3: (OPTIONAL): Cover pan with a square of wax paper and
  lid, pushing down firmly. Steam for 2 to 3 minutes to dissolve the sugar
  crystals.  (Listen to make sure the pot doesn't boil over.  To double
  check, remove lid, leaving the wax paper in place.) STEP 4:  Wash down any
  crystals clinging to the sides with a brush dipped in hot water from the
  thermometer bath.  Introduce the prewarmed thermometer.  No need to stir.
  STEP 5:  Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry.  If your mixer is a
  heavy duty one, you can wait until the bubbles in the syrup become very
  large and airy before beating the egg whites.  Otherwise, do it now when
  the thermometer registers 240øF.  STEP 6:  Test the syrup when the
  thermometer registers 246øF.  Continue testing until it reaches the
  firm-ball stage, 246ø to 260øF.  Syrup will be hard to scrape up in ice
  water.  It will have to be forced into a ball, but once formed, it should
  hold its shape but give under pressure.  Return the thermometer to the hot
  water bath to soak clean. STEP 7:  Dribble the syrup into the egg whites in
  a slow, steady stream, beating at slow speed.  Tilt the syrup pan to get
  the last drop but do not scrape the pan.  Once the syrup is completely
  incorporated, change to a flat whip if you have one. STEP 8:  Have patience
  and continue beating.  The amount of time you spend mixing depends on the
  power of your mixer.  If you have a heavy duty or commercial one, you can
  go to full speed and make the divinity in less than 5 minutes. With less
  powerful ones, it can take up to 20 minutes. The important thing is to beat
  at the highest speed of your mixer.  Also if it is a hot and humid day, it
  will take longer also. STEP 9:  Test the divinity. The first and most
  important test occurs when you lift the beaters. If the candy falls back in
  ribbons that immediately merge back into the batter, it isn't done.
  Eventually, a stationary column will form between the beaters and the bowl.
  Candy will lose its sheen/gloss and stop being sticky; a teaspoonful
  dropped onto wax paper will hold its shape, even a peak. If you machine is
  laboring and the candy is not quite there yet, you have two choices: Pour
  anyway and put into a frost free freezer to set up....or finish by hand.
  STEP 10:  Fold in the flavorings and nuts and/or other optional items using
  the mixer or if very thick, a wooden spoon. STEP 11: Drop or spread the
  divinity either on wax paper covered cookie sheets or the buttered pan.
  Dripping it by teaspoon is harder work for you but it ripens quicker and is
  ready to eat sooner.  A neat trick is to put the candy into a pastry bag
  and pipe onto the wax paper. If you spread it in the pan, you will have to
  wait up to 24 hours before it is ready. But you maybe one of those that
  think it is better when it is 24 hours old. Score and cut into squares.
  Store in an airtight container at room temperature or in a refrigerator.
  Makes 1 pound but looks like more. Recipe CANNOT be doubled; it can be
  frozen but not for extended periods of time.

      2 ts Peanut, almond, or walnut
           -oil
 
  DIRECTIONS: For Truffles: In double boiler, melt broken chocolate, stirring
  constantly. (Or microwave 2 1/2 to 3 minutes on medium.) Remove chocolate
  from heat; blend in butter. Stir in cream, then liqueur. Combine with
  chopped nuts or candied fruit if desired. Chill 10-15 minutes, stirring
  frequently until thick enough to hold a shape. Drop by heaping teaspoon or

      Title: Brown Sugar Fudge - Penuche
 Categories: Candies, Christmas
   Servings:  6
 
      1 c  White Sugar, Granulated
      1 c  Light Brown Sugar, Firm Pack
    1/2 c  Heavy (Whipping) Cream
      3 tb Molasses *
      2 oz Unsweetened Chocolate
      4 tb Butter
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
    1/2 c  Chopped Nuts, Optional
 
  * This is to taste.  The original recipe called for 4 T of Molasses.
  ~-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  STEP 1:  PREPARE:  Prewarm the thermometer in hot water; use a 2-quart
  saucepan; butter the upper sides (inside) of the saucepan; measure all
  ingredients except the vanilla and optionals, and dump into the saucepan.
  Grease and if necessary, line a 5 X 10-inch pan.  Fill glass with ice cubes
  and water and the sink with 1/2 inch of cold water. STEP 2: Dissolve the
  sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, over low heat until the
  butter melts, the gritty sounds cease, and the spoon glides smoothly over
  the bottom of the pan.  Increase the heat to medium and bring to a boil.
  STEP 3:  Boil, after washing down any crystals that may have formed, with a
  pastry brush dipped in hot water from the thermometer bath, using as little
  water as possible.  Introduce the prewarmed thermometer.  Reduce the heat
  while keeping the fudge at a boil.  Stir no more than necessary. STEP 4:
  Test the fudge mixture in the ice-cold water when the mixture thickens and
  bubbles become noisy.  Ball, formed in ice water, should hold its shape
  until the heat from your had begins to flatten it and should be al dente --
  slightly chewy -- between 230øF and 240øF.  Because of the molasses and
  brown sugar, it can ball at a lower temperature than some other fudges.
  STEP 5:  Shock by placing the saucepan in the cold water in the sink. STEP
  6:  Seed by adding, without stirring, the vanilla.  Then allow to cool.
  STEP 7:  Stir when luke warm and "skin" forms on the top (110øF). Return
  the thermometer to its hot water bath to soak clean. Stir the fudge
  thoroughly but not vigorously by hand, with an electric mixer, or with a
  food processor.  Pause frequently to allow the fudge to react. STEP 8:
  Watch for the fudge to thicken, lose its sheen, and become lighter in color
  or streaked with lighter shade, give off some heat, suddenly stiffen. If
  mixing by had, the fudge will "snap" with each stroke; by mixer, mixer
  waves will become very distinct, by food processor, fudge will flow
  sluggishly back to the center when the processor is stopped. STEP 9: Add
  the optionals (1/2 Cup Chopped Nuts (walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts,
  filberts)) before the fudge totally candies. STEP 10: Pour, score, and
  store when cool in an airtight container in the refrigerator or at room
  temperature. YIELD: 1 pound of fudge. Recipe is easily doubled and can be
  frozen. VARIATIONS: HONEY BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1, eleminate the
  unsweetened chocolate and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup of honey. The
  honey causes the fudge to ball at a higher temperature. CHOCOLATE HONEY
  BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, replace the heavy cream with light cream or
  evaporated milk and replace the molasses with 1/4 cup of honey. ORANGE
  BROWN SUGAR FUDGE:  In Step 1, eleminate molasses, chocolate but add 1 Tbl
  corn syrup.  In Step 6, add 1 T grated orange zest, plus if you can get it,
  1 tsp of pure orange extract. PEANUT BUTTER BROWN SUGAR FUDGE: In Step 1,
  eliminate the molasses and chocolate, replace the heavy cream with 1/4 cup
  of milk and 1/4 cup of creamy peanut butter. To intensify the peanut butter
  flavor, add 1/3 of a cup of salted peanuts in Step 9. PRALINE BROWN SUGAR
  FUDGE:  In Step 1, eliminating the molasses is optional -- you'ss get a
  more Southern praline with it, a milder one without it--or compromise and
  use only 1 T.  Eliminate the chocolate. In Step 3, when the mixture begins
  to thicken, add 1-1/2 cups of pecan halves slowly so as not to break the
  boil or cool the mixture too quickly.

      3    Plump, pink grapefruit,
           - preferably organic
  2 1/2 c  Sugar
  1 1/4 c  Water
      2 tb Corn syrup
           Superfine sugar; for coating
      5 oz Semisweet chocolate
      1 tb Butter
 
  SCORE GRAPEFRUIT INTO QUARTERS and carefully pull off peels or juice fruits
  and cut halves again in half. Place peels in large pan, cover them with
  cold water and bring to boil. Simmer 25 minutes. Remove peels and let them
  cool until they are easy to handle. Hold peels firmly against counter and
  gently scrape away most of white pith just below skin. Cut cleaned peels
  into strips with knife or scissors as narrow or wide as you like. In
  2-quart saucepan, mix together sugar, water and corn syrup. Bring to boil.
  When syrup is clear, add peels, lower heat and cook slowly until peels are
  translucent, about 1 hour. Set cake rack over baking sheet. Remove peels a
  few at a time and spread them out on rack to drain about 15 minutes. While
  they are draining, thickly cover large plate with super- fine sugar. Set
  several pieces at a time in sugar and turn them to coat them. When evenly
  coated, set them aside on another plate or piece of parchment paper thinly
  coated with sugar. This process will need to be done in several batches. If
  sugar become lumpy with beads of syrup, pass it through a strainer, then
  continue using it. Set aside sugared peels about 1 hour or until they are
  dried. Carefully package them in tin or plastic container and store either
  in cupboard or refrigerator. To dip peels in chocolate, melt semisweet
  chocolate over simmering water along with butter. Stir well to ensure that
  mixture is smooth before removing from heat. Dip each rind into chocolate,
  coating most of it but leaving a little "handle" to grasp. Or, completely
  immerse each rind in chocolate, then remove with 2 forks or pair of
  chopsticks. Set slices on parchment paper or cake rack and place in cool
  place to harden. Once chocolate has set, pieces can be stored in
  refrigerator. Chocolate will discolor when it cools but will become dark
  and glossy again once brought to room temperature.

  With spoon, remove white inner portion of peel. With knife or tiny star
  cookie cutter, cut a few stars from peel, if desired. With scissors or
  sharp knife, cut rest of peel in thin strips. Make syrup by boiling 2 cups
  sugar with 1 cup water. Add a little red or green food coloring. (A drop or
  two of yellow coloring with red improves the finished color.) Add peel;
  cook over low heat until peel has a clear, candied appearance. Remove peel,
  2 or 3 pieces at a time, allowing excess syrup to drain back into saucepan.
  Roll strips separately into remaining 1 cup sugar until well coated. Place

                          Stages of Syrup Cooking Slightly more cooking is
  required on damp or rainy days than on a dry , clear day. Allowance is made
  for this in the following table. The higher temperature should be used on a
  damp day while the lower is right for clear weather. Soft ball, for
  fondant, fudge, panocha_______________ 234F. to 238F. Firm ball, for
  caramels______________________________ 246F. to 248F. Hard ball, for
  taffy_________________________________ 265F. to 270F. Crack stage, for
  butterscotch________________________ 290F. to 300F. Hard crack, for
  brittles, sticks, lollypops__________ 300F. to 310F. Hard crack stage, for
  clear hard candies_____________       to 310F.
                            Cold Water Test
      Pour about 1/2 teaspoon os the hot candy into a cup nearly full of very
  cold water. Shape the syrup with the fingers of one hand. Soft ball: The
  syrup can be formed into a soft ball which flatens on removal from the
  water. Firm ball: The syrup can be formed into a ball which offers some
  resistance to the fingers. Hard ball: The ball which is formed is
  distinctly chewy. Crack: The mixture sounds britle when struck against the
  side of the cup; it can be broken by crushing between the fingers. Hard
  crack: The brittle mixture will not stick to the teeth.
      If a thermometer is used, it should be tested in boiling water. It
  should register 212 F. If 214 F., cook candy 2 degrees higher, if 210 F.,
  cook candy 2 degrees lower. Make your adjustments accordingly.

      Title: Candy Melt Roses
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  6
 
     14 oz Candy Melts - (1 package)
    1/2 c  Light corn syrup
 
  Melt candy melts according to package directions.  Add heated light corn
  syrup and stir until thoroughly mixed.  Let set at room temperature in an
  airtight plastic bag for at least 24 hours or up to one week. Candy becomes
  easier to work with as it sets.  When ready to use, knead a small amount
  until it reaches a workable consistency.
  
  MODELING A ROSE: Start with the base and mold a cone that's approximately
  1-1/2 inch high from a 3/4-inch diameter ball of modeling candy. Next, make
  petals.  Flatten 3/8-inch ball of modeling candy into a circle that's about
  1/4-inch thick on one side and about the diameter of a dime. Make several
  petals this size. Wrap first petal around the point of the cone to form a
  bud.  Now press three more petals around the base of the bud. Gently pinch
  edges of petals.  Make five more petals using slightly larger balls of
  modeling candy.  Flatten, then thin edge with finger and cup petals. Press
  petals under first row of petals. Continue adding petals, placing them in
  between and slightly lower than previous row. For a fuller flower, continue
  adding petals in this manner.
  
  TO MAKE CANDY LEAVES: On the back of clean, thoroughly dried, grape or rose
  leaves, paint on melted Candy Melts with a soft pastry or decorator's
  brush. Pull out pointed or curved edges to resemble certain kinds of
  leaves. Let coating set and when completely dry, carefully peel off candy.

 Categories: Chocolate, Candies
   Servings:  1
 
      3 c  Milk
     13 oz Powdered sugar
           Eggsize piece of glucose
  3 1/4 oz Chocolate in tablets
  1 1/2 oz Butter
    1/2    Vanilla bean
 
  Put milk, sugar, vanilla bean and glucose into a stewpan. Put the chocolate
  into a round-bottomed copper pan and melt it slowly on the stove.
  Meanwhile, heat the mixture in the stewpan, not letting it boil, since you
  merely want to melt the sugar and glucose. When completely melted, pour
  this mixture, bit by bit, into the chocolate, while stirring. When
  thoroughly mixed, cook at moderate heat, constantly stirring. Cook to the
  'ball' stage. (To test the stage of cooking by finger, dip the thumb and
  index finger into cold water, then into the mixture, bringing the 2 fingers
  together and dipping them again into water. This should be done quickly to
  avoid burning. The mixture forms a ball that can be rolled with the tip of
  the fingers.) Remove from the fire, add the butter, mix well, and pour onto
  an oiled marble slab in an oiled, iron framework. Let cool and cut.

      8 oz Cream

      1 oz Butter
      1 oz Cognac

MMMMM-----------------------------ENROBING----------------------------------
      1 lb Bittersweet chocolate
      1 lb Cocoa
 
  It is important to use an excellent quality chocolate when making truffles
  since it is the primary ingredient. Valhrona is my first choice and
  Callebaut is my second.
  
  BRING THE CREAM TO A BOIL and pour it over the cut chocolate. Allow to
  stand 1-to-2 minutes and stir smooth. Beat in the softened butter and cool
  to set. Beat with an electric mixer (using a paddle attachment if
  available) on medium speed until light. Beat in Cognac. Pipe out small
  truffles on parchment or waxed paper with a pastry bag fitted with a
  1/2-inch plain tube. Refrigerate to set. Melt the chocolate. Sift the cocoa
  into a deep pan. Dip the truffles in the melted chocolate and then deposit
  them in the cocoa, shaking the pan to cover them. After the covering sets,
  shake the truffles in a strainer to remove the excess cocoa.

      Title: Chocolate Balls with Cherry Centers
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  6
 
     50    Whole candied cherries
    3/4 c  Cherry brandy (more may be
           -necessary)
    1/2 lb Sweet milk chocolate, broken
           -into pieces
    1/4 lb Unsweetened baking
           -chocolate, broken into
           -pieces
  1 1/3 c  Powdered sugar
    7/8 c  Butter, softened
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa
           Powdered sugar
           Unsweetened cocoa
 
  Soak the cherries in the brandy overnight or longer.  Drain the cherries,
  reserve the brandy.
  
  Cream the butter and sugar in a mixer.  In a double boiler, melt the
  chocolates.  Spoon the melted chocolate, spoon by spoon, into the butter
  and sugar mixture and mix thoroughly by hand.
  
  Add reserved brandy to sugar and chocolate mixture and stir by hand until
  all is absorbed.  Add 3 T. cocoa and mix by hand.
  
  Put mixture in the freezer and thoroughly chill.  Prepare a surface to
  assemble the balls.  Mix equal amounts of cocoa and powdered sugar, about
  1/3 cup each.  On a piece of waxed paper, heavily dust with the cocoa
  powdered sugar mixture.  Remove the chocolate from the freezer when it is
  chilled and stiff.  For each cherry, spoon out a heaping teaspoon of the
  chocolate and drop on dusted paper. Dip your fingers into the cocoa/sugar
  mixture and flatten chocolate to a small pancake. Place a cherry in the
  center and fold chocolate around it.  Gently roll the ball between your
  palms to form and finish by rolling the ball in the cocoa/sugar mixture.
  Repeat for each cherry.  If the chocolate mixture softens, return to the
  freezer to firm up.
  
  Place the completed balls in a container with a lid and store in the frig.
  
  These balls are dense and heavy with a rich chocolate flavor.  For a
  lighter flavor, I suggest you omit the unsweetened baking chocolate and add
  1/4 lb. more milk chocolate.
  
  Licking your fingers is not permitted during the assembly, but manditory
  after you are done.  (grin)

      Title: Chocolate Covered Candied Cherries
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  6
 
     50    Whole candied cherries
    3/4 c  Cherry brandy
    1/2 lb Sweet milk chocolate, broken
           -into pieces
    1/4 lb Unsweetened baking
           -chocolate, broken into
           -pieces
  1 1/3 c  Powdered sugar
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa
           Powdered sugar
           Unsweetened cocoa
 
  Soak the cherries in the brandy overnight or longer.  Drain cherries,
  reserve the brandy.
  
  Cream butter and sugar with a mixer.  In a double boiler, melt the
  chocolates. Spoon the melted chocolate, spoon by spoon, into the butter and
  sugar mixture and mix thoroughly by hand.
  
  Add reserved brandy to sugar and chocolate mixture and stir in my hand
  until all is absorbed.  Add 3 T. cocoa and mix by hand.
  
  Put mixture in a clean bowl and thoroughly chill in the freezer. Meanwhile,
  make a 50-50 mixture of powdered sugar and cocoa.  Begin with 1/3 c. EACH
  and mix thoroughly.  Heavily dust a sheet of waxed paper on a working
  surface.
  
  When the chocolate mixture is chilled and very stiff, remove from the
  freezer. Drop by teaspoonfuls on dusted working surface and dust your
  fingers in the sugar/cocoa mixture, press with fingers to make a small flat
  shape with the chocolate.  Drop a cherry in the center and form a ball
  around the cherry.
  
  Working quickly, complete the shape by rolling the ball between your palms.
  
  Roll ball in sugar/cocoa mixture to coat.  Continue working until the
  chocolate mixture is too soft to continue.  Return to freezer to chill some
  more and continue until all the chocolate and cherries are gone.
  
  The chocolate covered cherries can be stored in the frig.
  
  For a lighter, sweeter chocolate taste, increase the sweet chocolate and
  decrease or eliminate the unsweetened chocolate.  The more milk chocolate
  you use, the more diffucult it will be to work with as it melts rather
  rapidly.
  
  You can also substitute and equal portion of semi-sweet bits (toll house
  chocolates) for the chocolate.
  
  Other candied fruit and liquors can be used according to your taste.
  
  Enjoy!

      Title: Chocolate Scotch Truffles
 Categories: Candies, Christmas
   Servings: 40
 
  1 1/2 lb Good-quality unsweetened
           -chocolate
      2    Egg yolks
      1 c  Confectioner's sugar
    1/2 c  Heavy or whipping cream
      4 tb (1/2 stick) unsalted butter
    1/4 c  Scotch whiskey
     30    Whole shelled hazelnuts
      1 c  Sifted unsweetened cocoa
           -powder, for dusting
 
  1.  Preheat the oven to 375F.
  
  2.  Place 10 oz. of the chocolate in a heavy saucepan, and melt over low
  heat.  Remove the pan from the heat and set aside.
  
  3.  Combine the egg yolks and 1/2 cup of the confectioner's sugar in a
  large bowl, and cream until well blended.
  
  4.  Combine the cream, butter, and remaining 1/2 c. sugar in a medium-size
  saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring until the butter and sugar are
  thoroughly melted.
  
  5.  Slowly pour the hot sugar mixture over the egg yolk mixture, whisking
  constantly.  Mix thoroughly and set aside to cool slightly. Then stir in
  the melted chocolate and the Scotch; beat for 1 minute.
  
  6.  Place the mixture in the refrigerator and chill until firm, 30 to 45
  minutes.
  
  7.  Meanwhile, place the hazelnuts on a baking sheet and toast them in the
  oven for 15 minutes.  Remove them from the oven and rub handfuls of nuts in
  a kitchen towel to remove the skins.  Set them aside.
  
  8.  Roll a spoonful of the chilled chocolate around each hazelnut to form a
  truffle about 1 inch in diameter.  Set them on a baking sheet lined with
  waxed paper, and chill thoroughly in the refrigerator 2 to 3 hours.
  
  9.  Melt the remaining 14 oz. chocolate in a heavy saucepan over low heat.
  Remove the pan from the heat.
  
  10.  Sprinkle a shallow dish generously with cocoa.  Dip each truffle in
  the melted chocolate, covering it completely.  Then lift it out with a fork
  and roll it in the cocoa.  Arrange the truffles on the baking sheet again,
  and chill before serving.

      Title: Chocolate Toffee
 Categories: Candies
   Servings: 64
 
      1 c  Sugar
    2/3 c  Light corn syrup
  1 1/2 c  Half-and-half
  1 1/2 oz Unsweetened chocolate
           - melted
  1 1/2 ts Vanilla
      1 pn Salt
 
  COMBINE THE SUGAR, CORN SYRUP, and 1/2 cup of cream in a large saucepan set
  over moderate heat. Stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves completely.
  Insert a candy thermometer, reduce the heat to low, and cook the syrup,
  stirring frequently, until the thermometer registers 238F. Blend in another
  1/2 cup of the cream, which will cause the temperature to drop, and
  continue to cook and stir until the thermometer reaches 236F or until a bit
  of the hot toffee dropped into a little cold water forms a soft, pliable
  ball. Mix in the remaining 1/2 cup cream and the melted chocolate. Cook the
  toffee, stirring constantly, lest it scorch. Cook toffee until the mixture
  becomes quite thick: A drop of it should firm up quickly in cold water.
  (NOTE: Even though the temperature of the toffee may not exceed 230F, if it
  firms in cold water, remove the pan from the heat at once.) Quickly mix in
  the vanilla and salt, then pour the toffee into a well-buttered
  8-by-8-by-2-inch pan. Cool the toffee completely, then cut it into 1-inch
  squares. Wrap each one in waxed paper or plastic wrap.

      Title: Chocolate Balls with Cherry Cordial Centers
 Categories: Candies, Martin
   Servings:  6
 
     50    Whole candied cherries
    3/4 c  Cherry brandy (more may be
           -necessary)
    1/2 lb Sweet milk chocolate, broken
           -into pieces
    1/4 lb Unsweetened baking
           -chocolate, broken into
           -pieces
  1 1/3 c  Powdered sugar
    7/8 c  Butter, softened
      3 tb Unsweetened cocoa
    1/3 c  Powdered sugar
    1/3 c  Unsweetened cocoa
 
  Soak the cherries in the brandy overnight or longer.  Drain the cherries,
  reserve the brandy.
  
  Cream the butter and sugar in a mixer.  In a double boiler, melt the
  chocolates.  Spoon the melted chocolate, spoon by spoon, into the butter
  and sugar mixture and mix thoroughly by hand.
  
  Add reserved brandy to sugar and chocolate mixture and stir by hand until
  all is absorbed. Add 3 T. cocoa and mix by hand.
  
  Put mixture in the freezer and thoroughly chill.  Prepare a surface to
  assemble the balls.  Mix equal amounts of cocoa and powdered sugar, about
  1/3 cup each. On a piece of waxed paper, heavily dust with the cocoa
  powdered sugar mixture. Remove the chocolate from the freezer when it is
  chilled and stiff. For each cherry, spoon out a heaping teaspoon of the
  chocolate and drop on dusted paper. Dip your fingers into the cocoa/sugar
  mixture and flatten chocolate to a small pancake. Place a cherry in the
  center and fold chocolate around it. Gently roll the ball between your
  palms to form and finish by rolling the ball in the cocoa/sugar mixture.
  Repeat for each cherry. If the chocolate mixture softens, return to the
  freezer to firm up.
  
  Place the completed balls in a container with a lid and store in the frig.
  
  These balls are dense and heavy with a rich chocolate flavor.  For a
  lighter flavor, I suggest you omit the unsweetened baking chocolate and add
  1/4 lb. more milk chocolate.
  
  Licking your fingers is not permitted during the assembly, but manditory
  after you are done.  (grin)
  
  There's yet another variation to chocolate covered cherries.  It's for the
  brave & daring at heart.
  
  You have to start in the summertime, when cherries are ripe.  You take a
  pound of them, a pound of rock candy, and a fifth of good brandy or
  bourbon. Mix together, & let set in the back of the 'fridge for 3-4 months.
  
  When you finally get around to making the chocolate covered cherries, you
  use the preserved cherries for the centers, & the liquor as the base for
  the cordial. Courtesy of: Al Martin

      Title: Coconut Almond Balls
 Categories: Candies, Chocolate, Microwave
   Servings: 26
 
      4 c  (8 1/2-oz) shredded coconut
           -(fresh package!)
    1/4 c  Light corn syrup
      1 pk (11 1/2-oz) milk chocolate
           -pieces
    1/4 c  Vegetable shortening
     26    Whole natural almonds (1-oz)
 
  Tastes just like Almond Joy.
  
  Line two large cookie sheets with waxed paper. Set large wire cooling rack
  on paper; set aside.
  
  Place coconut in large bowl; set aside.
  
  Place corn syrup in a 1-cup glass measure. Microwave on high (100%) 1
  minute or until syrup boils. Immediately pour over coconut. Work warm syrup
  into coconut using the back of a wooden spoon until coconut is thoroughly
  coated. This takes a little time, and yes, there is enough syrup.
  
  Using 1 level measuring tablespoon of coconut, shape into a ball by
  squeezing coconut firmly in palm of one hand, then rolling between both
  palms. (HINT: Measure out all of the coconut then roll into balls.) Place 2
  inches apart on wire racks. Let dry 10 minutes. Reroll coconut balls so
  there are no loose ends of coconut sticking up.
  
  Place milk chocolate and shortening in a 4-cup glass measure or 1 1/2 quart
  microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high 1 to 2 minutes or until mixture can
  be stirred smooth and is glossy; stirring once or twice.
  
  Working quickly, spoon 1 level measuring tablespoon of the chocolate over
  each coconut ball, making sure chocolate coats and letting excess chocolate
  drip down onto waxed paper. While chocolate coating is still soft, lightly
  press whole almond on top of each. Let stand to set or place in
  refrigerator. Store in a single layer in airtight container. Keeps best if
  refrigerated. Makes 26.

  syrup forms a soft ball in coldwater.  Set pan over boiling water.
  
  To build the pyramid, lightly dip the bottom oof a cream puff in syrup and
  set on the edge of the circle, syrup-side down.  Repeat with 9 more puffs,
  forminga ring. For the secong row,arrange a slightly smaller  ring of puffs
  overthe spaces between the puffs in the first row, inclinin g the second
  row slightly inward.  Fill in  the center with more puffs for support.
  
  Continue building the pyramid in decreasing rings, filling in cent er for
  support as needed, until you have completed 8 rows.
  
  Top with one puff,. Sprinkles the Croquembouche lightly with 1/4 cup
  siftedicingsugar. To serve, lift one ortwo puffes at a time off the
  pyramid, starting from the top. Serves 8 - 10.

      Title: Easter Mints Kids Can Make
 Categories: Candies, Kids
   Servings:  1
 
    1/3 c  Soft butter
    1/3 c  Light corn syrup
    1/2 ts Salt
      1 ts Flavoring
  3 1/2 c  ( 1 lb ) sifted
           -confectioner's sugar
           Large bowl
           Wooden spoon
           Paper plates
           Pencils
 
  This is a no-cook recipe the children can mix with their hands. Flavor it
  with any of the liquid flavorings in the supermarket, such as strawberry
  and lemon. If you want, you can instead divide it into three portions and
  add a few drops of food coloring to tint it yellow, red, and green. The
  knead a small amount of flavoring into each one. This recipe makes about 1
  1/2 lbs of candy.
  
  Help the children measure all the ingredients into the large bowl. They can
  take turns stirring it with the wooden spoon until it becomes too stiff.
  Then they can knead it with their hands. They should continue kneading
  until the dough is smooth.
  
  Give each child a paper plate and a pencil. Tell them to turn their plates
  OVER and write their names on the Bottom to prevent pencil lead from
  getting on their mints. Help them hold their pencils correctly. Make sure
  they use upper and lower case letters.
  
  Give each child a portion of dough on his or her plate. The children can
  pinch off pieces, roll them into balls, and press them lightly with a fork
  to make a fancy butter mint. Children who cannot roll the candy into balls
  can make snakes, cut the snakes into pieces, and press the pieces with a
  fork. They might eat the pieces with the fork, but that's ok too.
  
  Leave the mints on the plates and refrigerate them for 30 minutes, until
  they become firm. Easter Mints taste even better the second day, if you can
  keep everyone from eating them all on the first day. Cover with plastic
  wrap and keep them in the refrigerator.

   Servings:  2
 
      3 c  Sugar
  1 1/3 c  Water
    1/4 ts Salt
    1/3 c  Light corn syrup
      1 ts Vanilla extract
 
  DIRECTIONS: Mix first 4 ingredients in large saucepan. Bring to boil,
  stirring. Cover, boil 3 minutes. Remove cover, and cook until a small
  amount of mixture forms a soft ball when dropped in cold water (238-F).
  Wash down sides of pan several times with a pastry brush dipped in cold
  water, using up and down motion. Pour out on ungreased platter. Cool to
  lukewarm (110-F). Add vanilla, and beat until mixture turns cloudy. Gather
  into a ball, and knead with lightly buttered hands until smooth and creamy.
  Put in bowl, cover with damp cloth, and store in cool place until needed.
  
  FONDANT DIPPED ALMONDS: Tint fondant with red and green food coloring. If
  desired, flavor green with wintergreen and red with peppermint. Melt each
  color in top part of double boiler over hot water. Dip rounded end of
  toasted almonds in candy; harden on waxed paper.
  
  FONDANT STUFFED DATES: Color fondant with red and green food coloring, as
  desired. Shape in small rolls, and fill pitted dates.
  
  BONBONS: Using 2/3 of fondant recipe for any one flavor of bonbon, work in
  desired flavoring and coloring a little at a time. Shape in 3/4" balls for
  centers. Bits of nuts, candied or dried fruits, or coconut can be added to
  these centers. Let stand on waxed paper, covered, overnight.
  
  Next day, melt remaining 1/3 of the fondant set aside for this batch in top
  part of metal double boiler over boiling water, adding flavoring and
  coloring to match fondant centers. Remove from heat. Set pan in cold water
  for a moment, and then put over hot (not boiling) water to keep fondant
  warm and soft. With dipping fork, or other fork, dip bonbon centers, one at
  a time, in melted fondant to cover. (Stir after each bonbon is dipped to
  keep crust from forming on top. If this fondant becomes too thick, reheat
  or add a few drops of hot water.) Tip bonbon over onto waxed paper covered
  tray. Decorative circles can be made by holding dipping fork on top of
  bonbon for a moment. Decorate at once with bits of nuts, candied fruits,
  silver shot or colored sugar, as desired. Leftover dipping fondant can be
  dropped on waxed paper to make patties. Store, covered, in cool, dry place.

    1/2 pt Strained fresh raspberry
           -juice
      1 lb Loaf sugar
      1 oz Powdered gelatin
           Colouring if necessary
      2 tb Cold water
     10    Drops lemon juice
 
  Raspberry Jellies Prepare raspberry juice by crushing the fruit, warming it
  in a bowl over hot water until the juice flows freely and then straining
  through muslin. Soak the gelatine in the cold water. Dissolve the sugar in
  the juice and boil up to 240 F or the soft ball stage. Add the lemon juice
  and gelatine. Re-heat to 240 F and pour into a tin previously rinsed in
  cold water.  If the colour is pale add a few drops of cochineal before the
  end, but fresh fruit should give a brilliant colour. When set, loosen the
  sides with a hot knife and stand the pan on a cloth wrung out of boiling
  water.  Turn the jelly out on to a board.  Cut into cubes and roll in very
  fine confectioner's sugar.  Stand the sweets in a warm place overnight so
  that the sugar crystals adhers. Blackcurrant Jujubes 1/2 pint pure strained
  blackcurrant syrup 1 oz granulated sugar 1 tablespoon pure glycerine 6
  tablespoon glucose 1 oz powdered gelatine Soften the gelatine in a little
  water.  Dissolve the sugar and glucose in the juice - very slowly, over
  gentle heat.  Add glycerine and bring to boiling point. Remove from heat,
  add gelatine and stir until dissolved. Re-heat but do not boil. Rinse a 6"
  sandwich tin with cold water; pour the jelly mixture in. Proceed as in
  second paragraph of directions for Raspberry Jellies. This is a very good
  sweet for irritated throats. Fruit Jellies All juicy fruits in season make
  delicious sweets.  Proceed as for Raspberry Jellies, using colouring when
  necessary to enhance the natural tint. Redcurrants, gooseberries - both
  green and red - blackberries, hips and pineapples are just a few to be
  tried.  Fresh pineapple must be well cooked if used with gelatine, as it
  contains a natural digestant which dissolves gelatine. Two methods of
  Crystallising: CRYSTALLISING CANDIED FRUIT (This is the chapter that the
  author said to use for crystallising the jellies. I assume where it says
  fruit you would substitute jellies.) A sparkling finish is much sought
  after in this class of sugar work, so here are two recipes-one very simple,
  the other correct and of lasting quality. SIMPLE CRYSTALLISING Dip each
  fruit very quickly into boiling water-just in and out-drain it on
  blotting-paper or butter muslin.  Have ready sufficient sieved granulated
  sugar spread upon a sheet of paper to accommodate the fruits. Roll them
  gently about in the sugar until completely coated.  Leave in a dry, warm
  situation for some hours to reduce any moisture.  They will have a
  satisfying appearance, glistening in the light. ADVANCED CRYSTALLISING A
  crystallising tray is much to be desired for this purpose, but to
  improvise, a baking tray, deep and able to accommodate two wire cake racks
  on top of each other, will serve very well.  Carefully measure how much
  liquid will be required to cover the fruits when they rest in the tin.
  Place one rack in the baking tin, arrange the fruits upon it so that they
  do not touch each other or the side of the pan.  Place the second rack feet
  upwards upon the fruits, holding them gently in place. Cut a piece of
  greaseproof paper the exact size of the interior of your saucepan. Fold it
  across and across, then nip the centre point out leaving a hole about 1" in
  diameter. Make a syrup by dissolving 2 pounds of granulated sugar in 1 pint
  (20 ounces) of water. This is your basic recipe- increase it
  proportionately if the amount will not cover the fruits in the tin. They
  must be entirely immersed. Bring the syrup to a boil and strain it through
  muslin wrung out in hot water. Return the syrup to the saucepan, bringing
  it up rapidly to 220-225 F, remembering that the higher temperature gives
  larger crystals, and is good for imposing fruits, while 220 F gives finer
  crystals suitable for cherries, grapes and nuts. Put the pan where it won't
  be jarred in the slighest degree, covering the actural syrup with the
  prepared circle of paper. Steam will escape through the central hole.
  Agitation of the pan will result in a "grainy" syrup, so tread warily. When
  slightly cool-about 15 minutes-tilt the saucepan so that the syrup flows
  gently around and over the fruits held down by the wire cake rack. Cover
  with a cloth and leave for at least 12 hours. Then, if you have a
  crystallising tray, draw off the liquid.  Otherwise, gently lift your tray
  of fruits from the baking tin.  In eigher case place the fruits in a warm
  cupboard to thoroughly dry off once more. They should be covered with
  shimmering crystals of a size to suit your taste, according to the original
  temperature of the syrup. You will be left with a quantity of syrup which
  cannot be used again for crystallising. It can, however be used to make
  delicious toffee or to sweeten stewed fruits. Used with apples in lieu of
  sugar, it gives a unique flavour to an Apple Cake.

      Title: Fudge a la Louise
 Categories: Candies, Chocolate, Christmas
   Servings:  6
 
      4 c  Sugar
      3    Squares dark baking
           -chocolate
  1 1/3 c  Milk
      2 tb Butter, plus extra for
           -greasing platters
      1 c  Chopped nuts
  1 1/3 ts Vanilla
 
  In a heavy saucepan mix together the sugar, chocolate, and milk. Place the
  pan over high heat and stir constantly until the choclate is melted and the
  sugar is dissolved. Bring to a full boil, and lower the heat so the candy
  continues to boil gently, not vigorously. Stir no more. Put a candy
  thermometer into the center of the mixture and cook until the temperature
  reaches exactly 232 F. Meanwhile, butter a large platter (turkey size) and
  a flat pan about 11 by 13 inches. When the fudge reaches 232 F., pour it
  into the readied platter - do not scrape the pan, but let it drip out. Dot
  with 2 tablespoons butter and let the mixture cool until the platter feels
  cool underneath. Add vanilla. Take a large slotted spoon and start to stir
  the liquidy mixture - it will take about 15 or 20 minutes. You will see a
  steady change from dark to light color, from glossy to dull, from liquid to
  solid. When the fudge begins to get dull, add the nuts and mix in
  thoroughly. Put fudge into the large buttered pan and press into shape with
  the flat of your palms. Cut into squares; store in airtight container if
  there's any left.

    2/3 c  Light Karo
    3/4 c  Water
      1 ts Oil flavor* & color
      1 ts Or more citric acid**
 
  Have color/flavor/citric acid ready when finished cooking! *More or less,
  some flavors are stronger than others. **Put citric acid in fruit-flavored
  candies for tartness. TEST YOUR THERMOMETER EVERY DAY! To test: Place it in
  cold water & bring to boil. If water boils at- say 210 instead of 212,
  reduce cooking time 2 degrees. ***I use a TAYLOR thermometer. Wilton sells
  them now. Spray *PAM in molds & on surface. Not too much & only once per
  session. USE A THIN PAN, NOT HEAVY! Candy must set a few minutes in the pan
  & the temp will rise, burning the candy in a thick pan. Bring mixture to
  boil. Put lid on for 3 minutes <to wash down sugar crystals>, add
  thermometer & DON'T STIR. When therm. reaches 285-290D. remove pot from
  stove.Wait for temp. to lower below 260^ before adding color/flavor/citric
  acid. <Will cook flavor out if too hot.> Cover pan after adding citric acid
  so it won't fade the taste. I add about 2 ts citric acid.
        DON'T STIR!  Use the tiny viles of Lorann oils. Avail. in cake supply
  shop or drug store.
   I pour the cooked candy into a GUTTMAN candy funnel <holds entire recipe.>
  Thats the quickest way to get it in molds befor it cools & hardens. *Of
  course, spray funnel! I pour some into molds & the rest onto my marble
  slab. The part on the slab: I roll it into a long cylinder & cut into
  "pillows" w/scissors. Dust finished candies with powdered sugar so they
  won't "melt" together. There is one very nice sucker mold. It is a white
  ring w/ a slit for the stick. <Don't spray stick.> All you do is spray
  mold, add stick, fill w/candy, cool & remove easily Comes in 2-3 sizes,
  round or heart-shaped. I beleive it is Guttman Brand & available here at
  Sugarcraft. About 2 dz in a pack. This is my kids favorite Christmas candy.
  You will want to make several flavors. Experiment on how-much flavor. All
  vary. *Don't add too much on the mints. Takes more on the
  cherry/strawberry/lemon/orange, etc. There are at least 50 oil flavors
  available to choose from! Shared by Dolores McCann, Hamilton OH

      Title: Hints for Using a Candy Thermometer
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  1
 
MMMMM---------------------CANDY CLASS, SUGARCRAFT--------------------------
 
  ...Learn all the secrets of really GREAT candy making! *The first thing
  that should be done each day, before you start, is to TEST YOUR
  THERMOMETER! To do: immerse therm. in cold water. Bring to a boil.
     At sea level water boils at 212 degrees <on a sunny day.> If your water
  boils at 210 degrees, you should reduce the cooking time by 2 degrees. Most
  of the time, water boils here about 208 d. Try not to cook candies on a
  rainy day. The barometric pressure, when the air is heavy, holds the
  mercury in your thermometer down. "Make candy when the sun shines," motto
  of a good candy maker. *I recommend a TAYLOR or WILTON thermometer. Use a
  thin (good quality) pan for candies that MUST STAY IN THE PAN for any
  length of time for cooling. If you leave the thermometer in the pan, you
  may notice the temp. rising even after the candy is removed fro the stove.
  Using a heavy pan, your candy will burn, in this case. Use a HEAVY PAN for
  fudges, fondants, etc., that are to be dumped immediately. Dolores McCann,
  OH-- teacher.

      Title: Horehound Drops
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  1
 
           Karen Mintzias
      1 c  Fresh horehound leaves
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
      2 tb Corn syrup or honey
 
  Put the horehound in a small nonreactive sauce pan and add the water. Bring
  to a boil and simmer, covered, or 20 minutes.  Allow to cool, then remove
  horehound and squeeze out all the liquid.  Add the sugar and corn syrup or
  honey to the pan, stir with a wooden spoon while bringing to a boil, then
  turn heat down to a gentle simmer.  If bubbles threaten to overflow the
  pan, reduce heat slightly and stir.
  
  Boil to the hard-crack stage.  If you have a candy thermometer, this is in
  the range of 330 F, but even so you'll need to test often toward the end of
  cooking to get the hardness right.  Keep a shallow cup of cold water
  nearby.  Stir the liquid occasionally, and watch how it falls from the
  spoon.  When it forms a thread, begin testing for hardness by allowing a
  drop of the mixture to fall into the cup of cold water.  Don't trust your
  fingers to examine the now-hardened drop in the cup; bite it.  If it's at
  all gooey or sticks to your teeth, keep cooking.  When it's hard enough to
  crack when you bite it, remove the pan from heat immediately.
  
  If the mixture crystallizes, just add a cup of water and an extra
  tablespoon of corn syrup or honey to the pan, scrape all the crystalline
  chunks into it, and begin again.
  
  Lightly butter a candy mold, cookie sheet, or other heatproof baking pan,
  and pour in the hot mixture.  If you're using a flat-bottomed pan, score
  the surface of the candy after it has cooled enough to become firm.  This
  will help in breaking it apart, which should be done as soon as the candy
  can be handled.
  
  After individual "drops" are formed, sift granulated sugar or powdered
  sugar over them to keep them from sticking together.  Store in a
  moisture-proof container.

  this fudge its unbelievably creamy, fudgey texture.  The mellow flavor
  comes from Irish Crem liqueur, used in both the fudge and the icing. Use a
  pastry bag to pipe the icing or a spoon to drizzle it onto the fudge. The

  Butter foil; set the pan aside.  Prick potato 2 or 3 times witha fork. Cook
  on 100% power (High) for 4-5 minute sor until tender, turning over once.
  Cool and peel.  Mash potato (you should have 1/3 cup).  Add liqueur, stir
  until smooth.  Set aside.
  
  In a 2-quart microwave-save casserole combine chocolate and margarine;
  cook, uncovered, on High for 1-2 minutes or until almost melted, stirring
  once.  Stir until smooth.
  
  Stir potato mixture into chocolate mixture.  Slowly stir in powdered sugar.
  Stir or knead until smooth.  Press into the foil-lined pan. Score into
  thirty-six 1-1/4-inch squares.  Press a walnut piece into each square.
  Cover and chill until firm.  Holding foil at edges, remove the fudge from
  the pan; cut into squares.  Drizzle Designer icing over fudge.

      Title: Marchepane
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  6
 
      2 lb Skinned, blanched whole
           -almonds
           Ice water
      4    Egg whites
  2 2/3 c  Confectioners sugar
    1/2 c  Orange juice
 
  Colors: Natural, or, if necessary, artificial parsley or mallow for green
  sandalwood or alkanet for red saffron or dandelion for yellow blue turnsole
  for light blue violets for lavender
  
  1. In a mortar and pestal or a blender, grind the almonds to a thick paste.
  Add small amounts of ice water, about 1/2 tsp. at a time, to prevent the
  almonds from becoming to oily.  Place almond paste in a large mixing bowl.
  2.  In another bowl, beat egg whites until they peak.  Gradually beat in
  the sugar. 3. Add the sweetened egg whites to the almond paste. With
  fingers wet in orange juice, knead the resulting mixture. If the mixture is
  too sticky to handle, add small amounts of orange juice, 1 tsp. at a time.
  Thoroughly knead for about 10 minutes. 4. Separate the marzipan into
  several sections, on for every color required for your sculpture. 5. In a
  separate small mixing bowl for each color, place the marzipan portions and
  cover the bowl tightly with a clean cloth tied securely or with aluminum
  foil.  Allow these to ripen or "age" in refrigerator for at least 24 hours.
  (One old recipe recommends aging for a fortnight). Two days ought to
  suffice. 6. Mix the natural coloring agents, into the aged marzipan. The
  stiff confection will be easier to knead if allowed to return to room temp.
  7.  Sculpture the paste according to your wildest fancy.  Wet fingers,
  preferably in ice water.

    3/4 lb Chocolate for dipping
           Regal Icing
 
  Put gelatin in top of double boiler; add cold water.  When gelatin softens,
  add boiling water and stil well.  Add sugar and salt.  Put over boiling
  water and stir until sugar dissolves completely.
  
  Pour into large bowl of electric mixer and beat at high speed until misture
  is thick but not as stiff as beaten egg whites.  Add vanilla.
  
  Meanwhile, spread flour 2" deep in a large pan.  Push an egg (in shell)
  into the flour  at intervals, making hollow spaces in which to mold the
  marshmallow mixture.
  
  Drop marshmallow mixture into the flour molds.  Sprinkle flour lightly over
  top and put in cold place until set.  Remove mixture from one mold and you
  have a  half-egg.  Trim the flat side of marshmallow half-egg to make it
  even.  You can dip it in melted chocolate to cover and decorate with Regal
  Icing.
  
  Or you can put two halves together to make an egg, as follows:  Dip the
  rounded part of a half-egg in melted chocolate; set aside to cool, flat
  (uncoated) side down.  Trim flat side of second half-egg (to make it even),
  lift from mold and completely coat with chocolate.  Quickly press its flat
  side against the flat side of the cooled half-egg and you have a whole egg.
  The chocolate will hold it together.
  
  When chocolate-coated eggs are cool, trim with Regal Icing put through cake
  decorator tube.  Make ruffles around them to cover seam where the two
  halves join and to provide decoration.  Write names of children on their
  eggs with the icing, or decorate with tiny designs pressed through fine
  tips of a cake decorator tube.  Frosting my be left white or tinted in
  pastel colors.  Makes 13 eggs (or 26 half-eggs).

 Categories: Candies
   Servings: 72
 
      1 c  Sugar
      1 c  Light corn syrup
    3/4 c  Water
      1 pk (1 3/4-ounce) powdered fruit
           -pectin
    1/2 ts Baking soda
  1 1/2 ts Orange extract
      1 ts Finely shredded orange peel
      4    Drops yellow food coloring
      1    Drop red food coloring
           Sugar
 
  Line a 9x5x3-inch loaf pan with foil, extending foil over edges of the pan.
  
  Butter the foil; set pan aside.
  
  Butter the sides of a heavy 1 1/2-quart saucepan.  In the saucepan combine
  the 1 cup sugar and the corn syrup.  Cook over medium-high heat to boiling,
  stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to dissolve sugar. This should take
  about 10 minutes.  Avoid splashing mixture on sides of pan. Carefully clip
  candy thermometer to side of pan.
  
  Cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, till the thermometer
  registers 280 deg.F., soft-crack stage.  Mixture should boil at a moderate,
  steady rate over the entire surface.  Reaching soft-crack stage should take
  about 10 minutes.
  
  Meanwhile, in a heavy 2-quart saucepan combine water, pectin, and baking
  soda. (Mixture will be foamy.)  Cook over high heat to boiling, stirring
  constantly. This should take about 2 minutes.  Remove saucepan from heat;
  set saucepan aside.
  
  When sugar mixture has reached soft-crack stage, remove the saucepan from
  heat; remove candy thermometer from saucepan.  Return pectin mixture to
  high heat; cook till mixture just begins to simmer.
  
  _Gradually_ pour the hot sugar mixture in a thin stream (slightly less than
  1/8-inch diameter) into the boiling pectin mixture, stirring constantly.
  This should take 1 to 2 minutes.  Cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute more.
  
  Remove saucepan from heat.  Stir in orange extract, orange peel, and yellow
  and red food colorings.  Pour candy mixture into prepared pan. Let stand
  about 2 hours or till firm.
  
  When firm, use foil to lift candy out of pan.  Use a buttered knive to cut
  candy into about 3/4-inch squares.  Roll squares in additional sugar. Store
  loosely covered.  Makes about 72 pieces.
  
  Cinnamon Gumdrops:  Prepare Orange Gumdrops as directed above, except
  substitute 3 drops oil of cinnamon and 7 drops red food coloring for the
  orange extract, orange peel, and yellow and red food colorings.
  
  Mint Gumdrops:  Prepare Orange Gumdrops as directed above, except
  substitute 3/4 teaspoon mint extract and 7 drops green food coloring for
  the orange extract, orange peel, and yellow and red food colorings.
  
  Lemon Gumdrops:  Prepare Orange Gumdrops as directed above, except
  substitute 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon extract, 1 teaspoon finely shredded lemon
  peel, and 7 drops yellow food coloring for the orange extract, orange peel,
  and yellow and red food colorings.

      Title: Rock Candy
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  1
 
      1    Glass jar or drinking glass
      1    Piece of cotton string
      1    Pencil or stick
      1    Paper clip
      1    Food coloring (optional)
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
           Additional sugar
 
  Tie a short piece of cotton string to the middle of the pencil or stick.
  Attach a paper clip to the end of the string for a weight.  Moisten the
  string very lightly, and roll in a bit of sugar (this will "attract" the
  sugar crystals from the syrup to the string).  Place the pencil or stick
  over the top of the glass or jar with the string hanging down inside.
  
  Heat the water to boiling, and dissolve the 2 cups of sugar into it.  For
  the biggest crystals FAST, heat the sugar-water solution a SECOND time, and
  dissolve as much additional sugar as you can into it.  Add a few drops of
  food coloring to the solution if desired.
  
  Pour the solution into the prepared glass or jar and leave undisturbed for
  a couple of days.  Depending on how much sugar you were able to dissolve
  into the water, you should start to see crystals growing in a few hours to
  a few days.

      1 c  Light corn syrup
  1 1/2 c  Water
  1 1/2 ts Salt

      2 tb Butter
      2 ts Vanilla
 
  Combine sugar, syrup, water, salt and glycerin in a 3-qt. heavy saucepan.
  Place on low heat and stir until sugar dissolves.  Then cook without
  stirring to the hard ball stage (260).
  
  Remove from heat and add butter.  When butter is melted, pour into a
  buttered shallow pan (about 13 x 9)
  
  When cool enough to handle, gather into a ball and pull until rather firm.
  Add vanilla while pulling.  Stretch out into a long rope and cut in 1 or 2"
  pieces.  Wrap each piece in waxed paper when hard; twist paper at both
  ends.  This will keep the candy from becoming sticky. Makes about 1-1/4
  lbs.
  
  Note:  You can tint the taffy while puling it.  Different flavors may be
  added, also in the pulling, instead of vanilla.  Pink taffy usually is
  flavored with wintergreen, white with vanilla, green with spearmint.

  3 3/4 c  White sugar
  1 1/2 c  Lily white syrup (or Karo,
           -must be colorless)
      1 c  Water
           Food coloring
           Oil based flavorings such as
           - Wiltons
           Tin foil
           Icing sugar, approximately
           - 10 cups, can be reused
           - over and over
           Sharp pair of scisors
           Candy thermometer
           Lots of volunteers to help
 
  Mix the white sugar, white syrup, and water in a medium sized pot. Add the
  food coloring you want (green for spearmint, orange for orange) Bring to a
  boil, and boil until candy thermometer reaches 300 F degrees. (Can take up
  to 20 minutes)   Stir to mix all the ingredients, but once it starts to
  boil, do not touch.  Pot must be big enough to allow for double, as it
  rises as it boils
  
  While the candy mixture is boiling, shape a large piece of tin foil by
  folding up the sides and ends.  (I use the large foil about 3 feet long) to
  create a large cookie sheet type shape.  Put the icing sugar on the foil to
  completely cover it, and bank up the sides with icing sugar.
  
  When the candy mixture has reached 300F, remove from heat.  Let sit about
  10 seconds and stir to cool slightly (heavy emphasis on SLIGHTLY) Then add
  about 1 to 1-1/2 tsp of the oil based flavorings depending on how strong
  you want the flavor.  Stir until mixed (may boil a bit and DON'T stand over
  top of pot as flavor with escape in the air and up your nose!! 8-} ) Once
  flavoring is combined, pour mixture onto the icing sugar and use rubber
  spatula to scrape all mixture out of pot.  Put pot, spatula and candy
  thermometer into sinkful of hot soapy water.  If you allow it to harden you
  won't be saying nice things about me at all!! 8-} As candy is cooling, keep
  checking by trying to pull up the edges.  Once it gets to the consistency
  that you can lift it a little, start cutting it FAST! I cut off a chunk and
  then cut it up into bite-sized pieces. The outside will cool first so you
  have to watch it.  If it hardens to quickly you will end up with a good
  size lollipop that you won't be able to cut. It will shatter like glass.
  Continue working your way around until all is cut. Then I take all the
  candy and put it in a strainer that is sitting over a bowl. Shake some of
  the excess icing sugar off candy and allow to cool thoroughly. Pack in
  airtight containers. I find Zip-Loc Freezer bags pretty good. This recipe
  makes about 2 lbs candy. Once I have done all the flavors that I want, then
  I set up all the bags and put about 10 of each flavor into a smaller
  zip-loc and seal.  They make great Christmas gifts for family and all the
  various people you give to....mailman, garbage man, paperboy, school
  teachers, your kids friends..etc.  I figure if the kids have to help me
  cut, they get some to give to their friends..  Besides.. makes a good bribe
  to get them to help!!

  sugar; take ball of sugar-potato mixture, about the size of a baseball,
  roll out as for pastry, and spread with crunchy peanut butter. Roll over
  and over like jelly roll; makes enough for two rolls, each about a foot
  long. Wrap in Saran or foil and chill well. Slice into 1/2" thick rounds.

  Debbie Tillman's notes: Now for the changes we use. When we are going to be
  giving this as a gift, we melt another 1/2 c of chocolate in the microwave.
  Use an 7x7x2 pan (or smaller than the 9x9x2). Spread the melted chocolate
  on top of the buttered pan that is covered with the nuts.  After the
  chocolate is spread on top, sprinkle more nuts on top while chocolate is
  still warm. Then cut into small sizes. After the candy is set, remove from
  pan; wrap individually with dessert foil. I get mine at the bakery supply,
  or a craft shop.

      Title: Truffes Au Chocolat (Chocolate Truffles)
 Categories: Chocolate, Candies, Christmas
   Servings:  1
 
      3 oz Chocolate
  1 1/2 oz Butter
      2 oz Powdered sugar
      2 tb Fresh cream
 
  Preparation: Put cream, butter and grated chocolate into a pan. The
  chocolate need not be grated fine. The cream can be replaced by skimming
  the top off raw milk poured into a wide basin and allowed to settle. Melt
  butter, chocolate, and cream in a double boiler, stirring to mix well. When
  melted, remove the double boiler from the fire, leaving the hot water in
  the bottom pan to keep it warm. Sift the powdered sugar in slowly, so that
  it will not form lumps, stirring constantly. Let stand 24 hr. in a cool
  place. (In winter, 12 hr. in a cold room will do.) At the end of this time,
  cut a piece of this chocolate about the size of a small nut, using a knife
  or spoon. Roll it into a ball in the palm of the hand until the outside of
  the bonbon begins to melt a little. Then roll it in grated or granulated
  chocolate, which will stick to it perfectly. Let stand 2 hr. before
  serving, but in a place that is not too cold, because these truffles are
  better when they are a little soft. Instead of rolling them into balls, you
  can also shape them to look more like truffles.

  Slowly melt the chocolate in the water, bring to a gentle boil, remove from

  fire to poach the eggs in the chocolate. Do not stop beating. Remove from
  the fire and add the butter and the praline paste. Let cool, beating from
  time to time (this cooling takes a rather long time). When the mixture
  begins to solidify, take some with a spoon, place it in some grated
  chocolate (prepared in advance), and shape to resemble real truffles. These
  truffles keep a week. To keep a longer time, substitute vegetable
  shortening for the butter.

 Categories: Candies
   Servings: 49
 
      1 lb Granulated sugar
    1/4    Level tsp cream of tartar
  3 1/2 oz Cornflour
  7 1/2 oz Icing sugar
      2 oz Clear honey
      2 ts Distilled rose water
           Natural red colouring (opt)
 
  From "The Food Watch Alternative Cookbook" by Honor J Campbell.
  
  Lightly grease or oil a shallow 7" square tin.  Place granulated sugar and
  1/4 pt water in a heavy-based saucepan.  Stir over a moderate heat until
  sugar has dissolved.  Bring to boil and boil quickly, without stirring,
  until 'soft-ball' stage is reached (240 F on a sugar thermometer, or until
  a little, when dropped in  a saucer of cold water, will just form a soft
  ball).  Remove from heat, stir in cream of tartar and then leave on one
  side.  While syrup is cooling mix 3 oz  cornflour and 7 oz icing sugar in a
  large saucepan with a little cold water, taken from a measured 1 pt. Add
  remaining water.  Bring to the boil, stirring all the time and cook for 2
  min.  Reduce heat and gradually pour the cooled syrup into the cornflour
  mixture, beating well with a wooden spoon. Bring to the boil and boil for
  20-30 min over a low heat, stirring continuously, when mixture should be
  very pale straw in color and transparent.
  
  Add honey and rosewater, mix thoroughly.  Pour half the mixture into
  prepared tin.  Put a Tbs of the remainder into a cup, add a little natural
  red food coloring and mix well.  Add the colored mixture to the remainder
  left in the pan and mix well.  Pour over the mixture already in the tin.
  Leave until quite cold.  Dip a sharp knife into icing sugar and cut Turkish
  Delight into 1" bars.  Mix 1/2 oz cornflour with 1/2 oz icing sugar and
  roll bars in mixture to coat evenly.  Leave for 3-4 hours, then cut into 1"
  squares and coat again in mixture.  Leave overnight. Pack.
  
  Makes 49 pieces.

    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Light corn syrup
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Vinegar
      1 ts Vanilla or other flavoring
           -such as orange or lemon, or
           -use:
    1/2 ts Peppermint or:
      1 oz Bitter chocolate, grated
 
  From Grandma Ruby's recipe file: newspaper clipping
  
  Cook sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar until a few drops of the
  mixture will make a hard ball in cold water, 260 degrees on a candy
  thermometer.  Pour onto a greased dish or platter, sprinkle flavoring over
  top and turn the outer edges of the candy in toward the center until cool
  and firm enough to handle.
  
  Best results are obtained in pulling if the tips of the thumbs and fingers
  are dipped in cornstarch or fat. Use only the fingertips to pull taffy.
  When mixture can be handled, take up and pull out with both hands. Fold
  over and pull out again.
  
  As the mixture becomes cooler and the longer it is pulled, it will become
  stiffer and can be pulled out in a longer strand.  Pull until it is
  difficult to pull out and the mixture seems quite firm.
  
  Pull into long thin strips and cut immediately with greased scissors and
  roll each piece in powdered sugar or wrap in wax paper. Store cooled taffy
  in an air tight container in a cool dry place.
  
  If the taffy sugars, it can be recooked by putting it in a pan with 2
  Tablespoons corn syrup and 1/4 cup water.  Stir until dissolved and then
  recook according to original directions.
  
  Finely chopped nuts or fruit, as well as other flavorings, are added as the
  taffy is being pulled.
  
  I wish I had a date for this...I'd say recipe is at _least_ 30 years
  old...possibly 40, maybe even more...  This is a lesson to all of you to
  date your recipes, including newspaper clippings!

      Title: Whiskey Balls
 Categories: Candies, Christmas
   Servings: 36
 
      3 c  Vanilla wafer crumbs
    1/2 c  Finely chopped pecans
    1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa
      2 c  Confectioner's sugar
    1/2 c  Bourbon
      3 tb Light corn syrup
           Salt, if desired
 
  1.  Blend together the crumbs, nuts, cocoa, 1 cup confectioner's sugar,
  bourbon, corn syrup, and a dash of salt.  Form into small balls the size of
  walnuts.
  
  2.  Roll each ball in the remaining 1 cup confectioner's sugar and place on
  a cookie sheet.  Chill in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.
  
  Note:  It is traditional in the South to use bourbon, but rye may also be
  used. This confection -- or at least a version of it -- was an early
  Southern version of those chocolate truffles that became the rage for
  chocolate lovers during the 1980s in this country. The whiskey balls are
  made, of course, with cocoa rather than chocolate.

      Title: White Chocolate-Coffee Truffles
 Categories: Candies, Christmas
   Servings:  6
 
    3/4 c  Whipping cream
      1 tb Instant espresso or coffee
           -powder
     14 oz White chocolate, very finely
           -chopped
      2 tb Kahlua
           Dipping chocolate:
      1 lb White chocolate, very finely
           -chopped
      2 ts Vegetable oil
      3 tb Chocolate-covered coffee
           -beans, very finely chopped
 
  1. To make the truffles: In a medium saucepan, bring the cream and espresso
  powder to a boil.  pour over the chocolate and whisk until completely
  melted.  whisk in the Kahlua. Refrigerate until completely chilled and
  firm.
  
  2. With a tsp, place pieces of the chocolate onto a foil-lined baking
  sheet.  Refrigerate to firm; roll into balls and refrigerate again for
  about 30 minutes.
  
  3. To prepare the dipping chocolate: In the top of a double boiler set over
  hot water, place the chocolate and oil. stir until almost melted. Remove
  the top of the double boiler from the heat and stir until the chocolate has
  completely melted.  continue to stir until the chocolate has cooled and
  reaches a temperature of 90 degrees.
  
  4. Prepare 2 baking sheets by lining with aluminum foil.  Dip each candy
  center in the melted chocolate, shake off the excess and place on the
  baking sheet.  When you have dipped a row of candies, top each with a
  little of the chocolate- covered coffee bean.  Before each dipping, stir
  the chocolate vigorously with your fingers.  If the centers become too
  soft, chill for about 30 minutes.
  
  5. Let the candies set for about 2 hours before storing in refrigeration.
  If the centers start to come through the bottoms of the chocolates, as
  often happens with soft mixtures, dip the bottoms again in melted and
  cooled chocolate.
