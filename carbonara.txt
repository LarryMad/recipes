Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a pan, put on medium heat and saute 50 grams of guanciale.
When crisp, remove the guanciale from the pan.
Put 2 egg yolks and a white in a bowl, add Parmigiano Reggiano to taste (I don't like it very much), freshly ground back pepper.
Whisk vigorously until well blended.

Cook 240 grams of pasta very al dente (3 minutes less than the suggested cooking time), drain and saute in the oil (already hot) for 3 minutes, adding cooking water to keep it moist.
Put the pasta in the bowl, mix well until creamy. Add some cooking water if it gets too dry.
Serve super-hot.
