Lightly mix 6 ounces ground beef chuck with a big pinch
of kosher salt. Form into two equal balls, and then 
shape into two flat patties. Lay two slices American 
cheese between them and form the meat around the cheese; 
make an indentation in the center of the patty. Heat a 
cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat; sprinkle the 
skillet with salt. Cook the burger 4 to 5 minutes per 
side. Serve on a soft bun.
