Classic Cheesecake
Directions:                    

Preheat oven to 325Â°. Prepare a springform pan with cooking spray.
In a small bowl, combine cookies and butter. Press evenly into the bottom and part way up the sides of the springform pan.
Using a mixer, beat cream cheese on medium speed until smooth. Slowly add sugar, vanilla, lemon zest, lemon juice, sour cream and heavy cream. Beat on low speed until fully incorporated.
Add egg yolk and eggs, one at a time, beating until fully incorporated.
Pour filling over crust and bake for 50 minutes or until center is partially set. Turn off oven and allow cake to rest in oven for 1 hour.
Remove cake from oven and place on a cooling rack for 1 hour. Place in refrigerator and cool for 40 minutes until ready to serve.
When ready to serve, run a knife along the inside edge of the pan and carefully remove the cheesecake from pan.
TIP: Make cheesecake in advance to allow proper cooling and setting. Cake will hold for 3 days in refrigerator.
