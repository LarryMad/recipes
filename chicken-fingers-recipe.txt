Ingredients
3 medium chicken breasts (free range)
2 eggs
1 cup almond flour
1 teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon pepper
2 cups tallow or coconut oil for cooking
Instructions
Cut the chicken in to strips or nugget size.
Beat eggs with 1 teaspoon of water in a medium bowl.
Add chicken strips and toss well.
In another bowl, mix almond flour, garlic powder, salt and pepper.
Heat tallow or coconut oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.
Once oil is hot, coat chicken in egg mixture and then dredge in almond flour mixture and place in pan. Cook 3-4 minutes per side or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove from pan and keep in oven to keep warm while additional batches are cooking.
Once all are cooked through, sprinkle with additional salt and pepper and serve with (optional) honey mustard sauce.
