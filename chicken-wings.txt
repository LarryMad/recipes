3 garlic clove, crushed
2 tbsp olive oil
3 tbsp cider vinegar
1 tbsp paprika
1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
2 tsp celery salt
4 tbsp pepper
 sauce (we used Frank's hot sauce)
3 tbsp honey
1½ kg chicken wing, halved at the joint

In a large bowl, mix together the garlic, olive oil, cider vinegar, paprika,
Worcestershire sauce, celery salt, hot sauce, honey and a couple of cracks of
black pepper. Add the chicken wings and toss around to make sure they’re fully
covered in the marinade. If you have time, leave the wings to marinate for a
couple of hrs in the fridge or ideally overnight.

Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Drain and reserve the marinade, then spread
the wings out on a very large baking tray. Bake for 30 mins, then pour off the
excess oil, add the reserved marinade and toss well. Increase oven to 200C/180C
fan/ gas 6. Return to the oven and cook for a further 30 mins, tossing a few
times to coat in the glaze as they cook. They should be sticky and glazed with
most of the marinade evaporated. Serve on a large platter alongside other party
snacks.
