Chili-An all American classic. Omit the ground beef/buffalo and add in a few extra cans of your favorite beans for a vegan friendly dish. Pair with a Santa Fe Brewing Co. Pale Ale or a Yazoo Dos Perros Amber.

1/4 Cup Canola Oil
1 Onion, finely diced
2 Cloves Garlic, minced
2 Jalapeno Peppers, seeded and diced
1.5 lbs 80/20 Ground Beef/Buffalo
2 Tablespoons Chili Powder
1 Tablespoon Cumin Powder
1 Tablespoon Kosher Salt
1/2 Tablespoon Black Pepper
1 Cup Dark Beer
1 28 oz Can Tomato Puree
1 28 oz Can Petite Diced Tomatoes
1 14 oz Can Black Beans
1 14 oz Can Kidney Beans
Shredded White Cheddar Cheese (topping)
Sour Cream (topping)
Sliced Green Onion Tops (topping)

Preheat a Dutch oven over medium heat; add oil. 
Next add onions and saute for 8 – 10 minutes, or until tender. 
Add garlic and jalapeno peppers and saute until just tender, about 2 – 3 minutes.  
Add ground meat and seasonings and cook until meat is just browned through, about 4 – 5 minutes, stirring on occasion.  
Deglaze the pot by adding the beer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a spoon.  
Finally, add the remaining ingredients, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer partially covered for 30 – 45 minutes.  
Remove from heat and serve with desired toppings.
