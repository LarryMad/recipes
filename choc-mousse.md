Elizabeth David's Chocolate Mousse
============
</header>

<main>
Ingredients
===========
4 eggs
120 g dark chocolate; broken into small pieces
2 tablespoons rum
2 tablespoons espresso

Notes
=====
Makes four servings.

The short version - per person - is 30g/1oz of chocolate, one egg, and one tbl of liquid per egg. In my variation, all the liquid is made up of coffee and rum, but either or both can be substituted with water.

Method
======

In a double-boiler, gently melt together the chocolate and coffee. When melted, mix in the rum, remove from the heat and allow to cool for a couple of minutes.

Separate the eggs and gently beat the yolks, Stir the yolks into the chocolate mixture. The mixture should easily pour off a spoon. If not, add a little warm water until it does (a tablespoon or two at most).

Beat the egg whites until they form stiff peaks and then fold gently into the chocolate, Ensure it's well-incorporated together, but don't over-mix.

Pour the mousse into one souffle dish or some small ramekins or sturdy glasses for individual serves - ensure the dishes are filled to a decent level.

Cover and chill in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes. Up to 3 hours is optimum.

Serve with whipped cream and/or a berry coulis and a sprinkle of chocolate shavings. Or just by itself is just fine.
