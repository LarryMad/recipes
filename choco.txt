All-purpose flour – Yes, regular plain flour (maida) is all you need for this cake. Do not use any self-raising as those contain more leavening.
Cocoa powder – I always use the ordinary unsweetened Dutch-processed cocoa powder. You can find this in the regular baking aisle.
Butter – I prefer to use unsalted butter so I can control the quantity of sugar in my recipe. And yet, if salted butter is all you gave go ahead and use it. Just omit salt in the recipe.
