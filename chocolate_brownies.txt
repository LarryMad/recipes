Ingredients
------------------------------

200g dark chocolate
100g unsalted butter, very soft

60g cocoa powder
15cm square brownie tin or baking tin greased and base-lined

Method
------------------------------

Heat the oven to 180C, gas 4. Break up the dark chocolate. 
Put into a heatproof bowl and melt gently in a pan over 
simmering water, making sure the water doesn't touch the 
base of the bowl. Remove the bowl from the heat and leave 
to cool until needed.

Put the butter and sugar into the bowl of a food mixer and 
beat until fluffy. Gradually beat in the eggs, beating well 
after each addition. Beat in the vanilla essence.

Spoon the cooled melted chocolate onto the mixture then mix 
in thoroughly. Sift the flour and cocoa powder onto the mixture
and gently stir in.

When completely combined, spoon the mixture into the prepared
tin and spread evenly.

Bake in the heated oven for about 20 mins until firm to the touch
but still a bit fudgy. The chocolate will continue to cook slightly 
for a few mins after coming out of the oven.

Remove the tin from the oven and set on a wire cooling rack. 
Leave the chocolate brownies to cool completely before cutting 
into pieces. Store the brownies in an airtight container and eat within 4 days.
