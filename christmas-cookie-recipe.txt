Sugar-Cookie Cutouts 

From http://www.marthastewart.com/1043860/sugar-cookie-cutouts

Ingredients

    2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
    1/2 teaspoon baking powder
    1/4 teaspoon salt
    1 stick unsalted butter, softened
    1 cup sugar
    1 large egg, room temperature
    1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Directions

    Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Beat together butter and sugar with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla. Reduce speed to low and gradually add flour mixture until combined. Shape dough into a disk and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until firm but still pliable, at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days.

    Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Transfer half of dough to a lightly floured piece of parchment; roll to just under 1/4-inch thick. Transfer dough on parchment to a baking sheet and freeze until firm, 30 minutes. Repeat with other half of dough.

    Line 2 baking sheets with parchment. Using a craft knife and the template (or a cookie cutter), cut out cookies and space 2 inches apart on parchment-lined baking sheets. Refrigerate until firm, about 15 minutes.

    Bake until golden on edges, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool completely on sheets on wire racks.
