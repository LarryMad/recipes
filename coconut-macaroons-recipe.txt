Coconut Macaroons

Ingredients:

14 oz Pkg. Coconut Flakes (I used sweetened)
3 Egg Whites
1/2 C. Sugar
1/2 tsp. Kosher Salt
1 tsp. Vanilla Extract

1. Preheat oven to 325.
2. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper (I bought my
parchment paper at Dollar Tree, if you don't have any on hand, grease your
sheet pan well)
3. Carefully separate egg yolks from whites..
4. Whip egg whites in a stand mixer until they begin to foam and turn a milky
white (or, if you have no stand mixer, a whisk and some muscle will do the
trick.)
5. Mix in Sugar, Salt, and Vanilla. Whip until smooth.
6. Fold coconut flakes into egg white mixture until coated.
7. Place spoonfuls of mixture on lined baking sheet. (I used a 2 Tbsp cookie scoop
for this to make uniform sizes and shapes)
8. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until macaroons are golden brown and firmed.
9. Allow to cool completely.
