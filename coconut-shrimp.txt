Ingredients:
 - 1/3 cup all-purpose flour (or whole wheat) (measured correctly)
 - 1/2 teaspoon salt
 - 1/2 teaspoon pepper
 - 2 large eggs, beaten
 - 3/4 cup Panko bread crumbs
 - 1 cup sweetened shredded coconut
 - 1 pound raw large shrimp, peeled and deveined with tails attached
 - vegetable oil or coconut oil

 Directions:
1. Start with 3 medium bowls. Combine flour, salt, and pepper in one. Beat the eggs in the second bowl.  Combine Panko and coconut in the third bowl.

2. Dip the shrimp into the flour, then the eggs, and then dredge the shrimp into the coconut mixing, pressing gently to adhere. You want a lot of coconut on each shrimp. Set the coated shrimp aside on a plate as you coat the remaining shrimp.

3. Add enough oil to cover the bottom of a large skillet on medium heat. Fry the coconut shrimp in batches - do not crowd them in the pan. I fried about 6-7 at a time. Flip after 2 minutes and fry the other side for 2 minutes or until golden brown. I like mine a little darker, so I fried each side for about 3 minutes.

4. Place the finished coconut shrimp on a plate lined with a paper towel as you fry the rest. Serve with your favorite sweet chili sauce or an orange chili sauce (which is 1 part Thai sweet chili sauce to 2 parts orange marmalade). I've tried this dipping sauce and it's very tasty as well.

5. Sprinkle with a little chopped cilantro (optional) and serve. Leftover coconut shrimp keeps well in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

6. Make ahead tip: Fried coconut shrimp freezes well, up to 2 months. Reheat for 10 minutes in a 350F oven-- or until thawed and warm.
