lalalalala(that's just my idiot friend shower-singing btw...it has nothing to do with coffee :D) )

So, Coffee.....
It's very simple, but only a few people ever get it done juuuusht right.

Take the coffee beans (you've gotta buy the beans...coffee powder is not for connoisseurs)
And then ground them, either in a mixer, or if you're feeling really old-fashined, try it by hand.
Add the amount you want into a cup.

For the truly hard-core: Boil water seperately, and then add it to the cup. Mix it and just smell the aroma.... "sigghhhh....!"

For those who like milk, boil the milk seperately, and add it to the cup. As with the water, enjoy....

And if you like sugar as well...don't add it after the water/milk directly into the cup. 
Add sugar while the water/milk is boiling and mix well. That'll ensure the right amount of sweetness for that perfect cup.

So, whichever way you like it...there you go!
Your perfect cup of coffee! :D
