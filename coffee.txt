The cookie recipe was distributed by a woman who
saw an add for the purchase of the recipe.
She thought that the price of the recipe was $2.50,
so she sent her Visa card number so that they could
charge her $2.50 on it.  Well she got her recipe,
but when she received her Visa Statement, she
then realized that she was charged $250 not $2.50.
She explained that she misunderstood the add, but
by then she already knew the recipe, so it was
too late.  She even took the matter to court, but all
her efforts were useless.  So, she wants everybody to
know and use the recipe, so please tell all your
friends.  I can't stand how much Mrs. Fields
charges for her cookies.  A 50 cent cookie cost
no more than 4 to 5 cents to make.  Doesn't that
just make you angry!  If this was a more honest
business, I wouldn't bitch about it, but it isn't
so I'm bitching about it!!  Let's stop such
profit making!!!  Use the recipe, give it to all
your friends, upload it to as many boards you
can, do whatever you can to stop this
madness!!!  I'd love to hear your comments.
Leave me E-Mail.  Thanx for your support!!!!!!!!!!!
