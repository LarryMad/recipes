This recipe is about a cake that can be done without using an oven.
It´s a very sweet childs cake.


What you need:
- Bahlsen butter biscuits, take the pure ones without chocolate
  Any other biscuits may do, if they are flat (2-3mm thick) and rectangular (~40x60mm) 
  (400-500g) and a bit cross baken.
- all vegetable shortening 400g
- cocoa powder 125g 
- sugar 250g
- one fresh(!) egg (beware of salmonella, because we don´t cook)
- a spoonful of butter


What you use:
- rectangular cake tin
- aluminium foil
- heat resistant bowl (~ 1,5l)
- mixer
- pot


What I do, feel free to follow this recipe on your own risk:

1. put aluminium foil in cake tin
2. butter the bottom and the walls with that spoonful of butter
3. use pot to smoothly heat the vegetable shortening until it is completely fluid.
   Do not overheat, put it beside the cooker after it became fluid to calm down a little.

   In the meantime:   
4. break the egg into the bowl
5. add cocoa and sugar

6. Now add the vegetable shortening in small shares while constantly mixing the ingredients with the mixer on slow speed
   (take you 3-4 minutes to empty the pot into bowl)
   The result should be a slow-moving cocoa-cream, still hot enough to pour.
  
   From now on you need to speed up, because the cocoa-cream stucks in short time.
  
7. put a first layer of biscuits into the cake tin
   (I prefer to cut the biscuits to fit the bottom)
8. add a thin layer of cocoa cream (some spoonful) and spread it over the biscuits

9. repeat steps 7+8 to build your cake layer by layer

10. put cake in the fridge for at least 2 hours, it needs to be served cold (cold dog`s cake)

11. overthrow the cake, it should detach easily from the tin
12. carefully remove the aluminium foil

Enjoy!
