bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter with both sugars; beat on
medium speed until light and fluffy. Reduce speed to low; add the salt, vanilla, and eggs. Beat until well
mixed, about 1 minute. Add flour mixture; mix until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.
2. Drop heaping tablespoon­size balls of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment
paper.
