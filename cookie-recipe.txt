Add a new recipe to the repository

On your own computer, add a new recipe for a food that you like and commit it on the master branch.

Push your changes

Push the master branch to your fork. If you're having trouble remembering how to push, you may want to rewatch this video. When you're finished, continue to the next screen to answer a question about where your commit exists at different points in time.
