Small pkg. Aunt Jemima Self Rising White Corn Meal
Eggs
Bunch of celery (2 stalks but you probably will have to buy a bunch)
1 white or yellow onion
1 bottle of sage
1 quart of buttermilk (preferably Bulgarian)
3 cans of cream of chicken soup (Cream of mushroom can be substituted but I've never done it)
Cooking oil (Crisco)
 
Tonight  mix 4 cups corn meal mix, 1 egg and enough butter milk to make the consistency of cake batter.  Heat oil  (enough to cover bottom and sides of 9 inch round pan) in 425 degree oven.  When oil is very hot add batter.  Cook until golden brown on top.  Turn out on plate and save for tomorrow.
 
Thursday, Crumble corn bread in large bowl.  Wash and dice onion and  2 stalks celery in very small pieces ( you could do that tonight).  Melt half stick of butter in microwave.  Add onion and celery and microwave for 90 seconds (just to soften veggies).  Mix with crumbled cornbread, add cream of chicken soup right out of the can and 1 tablespoon of sage (I use more sage but some people don't like it).  If mixture is very dry add a little buttermilk but not much. It  needs to be a little dry or it will not cook properly.  Preheat oven to 425.  Add oil to 9 by 13 pan and  add enough  to coat bottom and sides with a little extra in bottom so dressing will be  somewhat crispy.  When oil is hot, add dressing batter.  Probably will take an hour or hour and a half  or more to cook.  Dressing is done when fork inserted in center comes out fairly clean.   If fork looks wet, dressing is not done but if it just has a little wet crumb on it, you can take it out.  Let set a few minutes and cover with foil.
