Ingredients:
- 6 eggs
- 1 pinch of pepper
- 1 tbsp of salted butter

Directions:
1. On a stove, preheat a 12-inch pan (or larger) to medium-low.
2. Whisk the eggs vigorously. This is a very important step. You want to whisk the eggs until they are foamy.
3. Add the butter to the pan. You know the temperature is right if the butter melts slowly but doesn't burn.
4. Add the whisked eggs to the pan. Start stirring immediately.
5. Occasionally shake the pan back and forth as you continue to stir.
6. The eggs will start solidifying after a few minutes. Keep shaking the pan back and forth. Take the pan out of the stove once the eggs stop sliding with the shaking.
7. Keep moving them around for a little bit (no more than one minute). At that point they should be ready to serve.
