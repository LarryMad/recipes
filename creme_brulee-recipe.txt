Jeff's Creme Brulee

Ingredients:
1C Heavy Whipping Cream
1/2t Vanilla
3 Large Egg Yolks
1/4C White Sugar
Pinch of salt

Utensils:
9"x13" pan or something similar with tall sides
Mixing cup/bowl that can withstand boiling temperatures and has at least 4 cup capacity
Whisk or fork
Saucepan with 2C capacity
Pot that can hold enough water to fill your pan about 1" deep
Creme brulee ramekins or small glass bowls

Instructions:
- Preheat Oven to 350F.
- Prepare some boiling water for later use - make sure it is enough to fill your pan 1" deep.
- In saucepan, heat heavy cream and vanilla until edges begin to bubble.
- While heating cream, whisk egg yolks, sugar, and salt vigorously in mixing bowl until light in color.
- When cream is hot enough, slowly pour 1/4 to 1/2 of it into the egg yolk mixture adding about 1-2Tbsp at a time. Take care as to not make bubbles in the mixture.
- Pour cream and egg yolk mixture back into saucepan with the rest of the milk and stir until combined. Do not stir too vigourously as to introduce bubbles into the mixture.
- Divide mixture into ramekins and place ramekins into pan.
- Put enough boiling water in the pan with the ramekins to reach half-way up the ramekins.
- Place in oven and bake for 30-45 minutes until centers are wobbly and edges are firm.
- Cool to room temperature, then refridgerate for 2 hours to overnight.
- Put enough sugar on each ramkein to cover completely (no creme visible) and carameliize sugar with small torch. Make sure to not burn the sugar.
- Allow to cool for at least 5 minutes and serve.

Optional:
- If you use a convection oven, it is not necessary to put any water in the pan with the ramekins. Also reduce cooking time by about 1/3.
- If you do not have a blow torch, you can caramelize the sugar with your oven's broiler setting. Place on top rack with broiler on and keep a close eye on it so it doesn't burn. Only do a few at a time so you can control it better.
- You can garnish the creme with orange zest just before placing in oven to add a little flavor.
