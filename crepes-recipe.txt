ingredients for 7-8 Crepes:

- 150 grams of cake flour
- 250 ml of milk
- 15 ml of extra virgin olive oil
- 5 grams sugar
- 3 large eggs
-, A pinch salt

Preparation:

We will teach you to make mass pancake house and then collect several complete recipes for crepes stuffed with all sorts of ingredients. But first it is important to you to prepare the dough and know get it right. This mass can be added or additional flavoring ingredients, but that depends on individual taste and if you want to try new flavors.

The crepes are ideal to serve as appetizers, main course or dessert, even as a full and rich snack, because you can fill almost any ingredient or ingredients that comes to mind.

The basic dough for pancakes is quick and easy to prepare, but bear in mind that this body needs time to rest from preparing until you can do on the griddle or skillet.

Let's now get to our dough recipe for crepes. We begin sifting and throwing flour in the bowl of a mixer. Also add a pinch of salt, sugar, eggs and milk, and beat rods, manual or those of the mixer itself. Once these ingredients are well blended, add the flour and beat back the rods. We should be a rather smooth and creamy mixture, which will keep in the refrigerator for one hour at least, so that the mass of crepes will become a little denser.

When you pass that time we will need a crepe, a tool specially made for crepes or skillet normal, although better if nonstick, so the pancakes are good and we do not stick. We will also need a bit of butter to make the crepes, without salt must not change the taste of our mass.

We take the dough from the refrigerator and put to heat the pan. We have used a medium, so that the crepes are not too large. We'll take a teaspoon of butter and once melted, pour in the pan mass crepes enough to cover the surface, being careful not to take too much and we have left a pancake too fat.

We must try to make it well done on both sides, for which you only have to turn when we see picking up color on one side and remove it when it is equal on both sides. Being a rather thin pancake, do not ye too long because you will be well done and you lose that characteristic texture and there is just so nice to eat.

When done place it in a large bowl and make another, so you end up with the whole lump. While you can start preparing fillings pancakes, or have them prepared in advance or go find yourself a helper doing while you prepare the crepes.

I am just serving, fill and enjoy some delicious crepes.
