Ingredients:
- 500g Butter (unsalted)
- 250g Unrefined golden caster sugar (we use Billington's)
- 4 Egg(s) (free range) medium
- 250g Self-raising white flour (we use Allinson)
- 2tsp Vanilla extract (we use Nielsen-Massey)
- 500g Icing sugar (we use Silver Spoon)
- 1tsp Vanilla extract (we use Nielsen-Massey)
- Food coloring
- Black, blue, red, white and yellow sugar paste icing

Directions:
	1. Preheat the oven to 180°C (160°C, gas mark 4) Line a cupcake tin with 12 cases.

	2. In a large bowl cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.

	3. Add the eggs on at a time, mixing between each addition and adding a spoonful of the flour if necessary. Follow by adding the vanilla extract.

	4. Carefully fold in the flour then spoon into the cupcake cases, until they are about 2/3 full.

	5. Bake in the oven for 25 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean.

	6. Leave to cool completely on a cooling wire.

	7. To make the buttercream, beat together the icing sugar and butter until light and fluffy, then add the vanilla extract and food colouring.

	8. Fill a piping bag with the icing and pipe swirls on top of the cupcakes.

	9. Roll out the sugar paste icing for your topper and using a knife or a circular cutter (depending on the design) cut out the shapes approximately 2.5 inches in width.

	10. Cut out the designs and letters (if using) with a sharp knife and brush the back lightly with water to stick to the other sugar paste icing.

	11. Place the sugar paste decoration on top of the buttercream swirl and serve.
