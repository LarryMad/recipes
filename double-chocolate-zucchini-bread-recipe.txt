Ingredients

    2 large eggs room temp
    1/2 cup coconut sugar
    1/4 cup organic coconut oil* melted and cooled to almost room temp
    1/4 cup smooth almond butter unsalted
    1 tsp pure vanilla extract
    1 1/2 cups blanched almond flour
    6 Tbsp raw cacao powder or unsweetened cocoa
    1/4 tsp fine grain sea salt
    1 tsp baking soda
    2-3 small medium zucchini peeled if desired and finely shredded (1 and 3/4 -2 cups gently packed, water squeezed out between paper towels)
    1/2 cup dark chocolate chips homemade or Enjoy Life brand

Instructions

    Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and line a medium loaf pan with parchment paper
    In a medium bowl, combine the almond flour, cacao or cocoa powder, baking soda and salt; set aside
    in a large bowl, whisk or blend together the coconut oil, almond butter, coconut sugar, eggs and vanilla until well combined and smooth.
    Add the dry ingredients to the wet until just moistened (batter should be quite thick) then fold in the shredded zucchini, then the chocolate chunks.
    Transfer batter to the parchment lined loaf pan and bake until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean, 50-60 minutes.
    Cool the loaf on a wire rack for 10-15 minutes, then gently remove the loaf by holding both sides of the parchment paper and continue to cool completely on the wire rack before slicing. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Enjoy!

Recipe Notes
*Use refined coconut oil to avoid coconut flavor, if desired. I love this one.
