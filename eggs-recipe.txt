Over-Easy Eggs:
	2 eggs (3 if hungry)
	salt
	pepper
	olive oil
	
1.) Put enough olive oil in a nonstick pan to cover the entire bottom and then some (the more the crunchier the eggs).
2.) Put the pan on medium heat on a stove. Wait until the oil is bubbling (important!).
3.) Add the eggs and cook until they look done. Enjoy!
