\cf0 3 serrano peppers					    1/2 store-bought rotisserie chicken, meat removed and \
1 pound small green tomatillos,			     shredded\
   husks removed					    1/4 head iceberg lettuce, shredded\
1 cup vegetable oil for frying			    1 cup cilantro leaves\
9 corn tortillas						    1 (8 ounce) container Mexican crema, crema fresca\
3 cups water 						    1 cup grated cotija cheese \
\
\
Cover a large griddle with aluminum foil and preheat to medium.high\
\
Cook the garlic, serrano peppers, and tomatillos on the hot griddle until toasted and blackened, turning occasionally, about 5 minutes for the garlic, 10 minutes for the peppers, and 15 minutes for the tomatillos. Remove to a bowl and allow to cool.\
\
Heat oil in a small, deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Using kitchen tongs, fry the tortillas individually, turning them once. They shouldn\'92t be in the hot oil for more than 5 seconds per side. Remove excess oil with paper towels and keep warm. Remember that the hotter the oil, less that the tortillas will absorb \
\
Place the toasted garlic, serrano peppers, and tomatillos, and the water in a blender and blend until smooth; pour into a saucepan over medium heat and bring to a boil. Dissolve the chicken bouillon into bouillon into the mixture, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. The sauce should`t be too thick\
\
Soak three tortillas in the cauce, one at a time, for a few seconds, fill them with shredded chicken, sprinkle the meat with some of the sauce, roll them and place them seam side down on a pasta bowl. Spoon a generous amount of sauce over them and top them with lettuce, cilantro, crema, and cotija cheese. Pour a little more sauce over the whole thing if desired.+Repeat the procedure twice more. Serve immediately.\
