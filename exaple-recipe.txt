Biscotti are twice-baked Italian cookies. I thought biscotti would be a very
 good candidate for whole wheat-ification. It is a fairly light, crunchy cookie,
  and is frequently made with nuts. Using whole wheat would only serve to
  compliment that flavor and texture. Until this recipe, however, I had never
   tried making it with whole wheat flour. I decided to give it a go with this
   recipe from Epicurious. I dropped the chocolate chips and reduced the amount
    of salt. I also used hazelnuts instead of walnuts, but you can use any nut
     you prefer.

Note: Set out the egg and butter ahead of time so that they can reach room
temperature.

This recipe makes approximately 30 biscotti.
