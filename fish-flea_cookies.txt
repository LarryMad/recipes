They really are oat-linseed cookies, but when grinding down whole linseeds it tends to smell of fish, and the ones that escape the grinding tend to look like fleas once baked :-)

Makes about 25 cookies

Ingredients:

75 g   rolled oats
100 g linseed (flax seeds)
100 g butter*
100 g sugar
70 g   coconut flakes
pinch of salt
cinnamon to taste
powdered ginger to taste
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 egg

Procedure:
- preheat the oven to 170 degrees centigrade
- if using whole linseeds, grind them down using a stick blender
- mix all dry ingredients
- flavour with cinnamon and ginger
- melt the butter and mix it into the other ingredients
- mix in the egg
- using two spoons, form into disks of about 1/2 cm thickness onto a baking sheet
- bake in the middle of the oven for about 20 minutes

* the butter can be replaced by coconut oil, which has melting properties similar to those of butter.
In case you use coconut oil, reduce the number of coconut flakes by about half.
