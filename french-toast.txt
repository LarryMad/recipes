--Ingredients

2 large eggs
1 cup milk
pinch salt
1 tablespoon granulated sugar, honey or maple syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
8 slices sandwich bread
butter

-- Directions

Whisk together eggs, milk, salt, sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon in a flat-bottomed pie plate or baking dish. 
Place bread slices, one or two at a time, into the egg mixture and flip to make sure both sides of bread are well-coated.
Melt butter in a large skillet or on a griddle. Place bread slices in skillet or on griddle and cook on medium heat until golden brown on each side, about 2-3 minutes.
Serve immediately or keep warm in oven until ready to serve, but no longer than about 30 minutes.
