Ingredients:
- 3 eggs
- 1/3 cup water
- About 1 cup hot red pepper sauce (recommended: Texas Pete)
- 2 cups self-rising flour
- 1 teaspoon pepper
- House seasoning, recipe follows
- 1 (1 to 2 1/2-pound) chicken, cut into pieces
- Oil, for frying, preferably peanut oil

Directions
- In a medium size bowl, beat the eggs with the water. Add enough 
  hot sauce so the egg mixture is bright orange. In another bowl, 
  combine the flour and pepper. Season the chicken with the house 
  seasoning. Dip the seasoned chicken in the egg, and then coat 
  well in the flour mixture.

- Heat the oil to 350 degrees F in a deep pot. Do not fill the pot
  more than 1/2 full with oil.

- Fry the chicken in the oil until brown and crisp. Dark meat takes
  longer than white meat. It should take dark meat about 13 to 14 
  minutes, white meat around 8 to 10 minutes.

House Seasoning:
- Mix ingredients together and store in an airtight container for up to 6 months.
