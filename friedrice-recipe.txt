Ingredients

8 dried shiitake mushrooms
3 tablespoons peanut oil
2 large eggs, lightly beaten with a pinch of kosher salt
4 scallions (white and green), thinly sliced
1/4 cup minced carrot
1 large clove garlic, minced
Pinch red chile flakes
1 teaspoon minced peeled fresh ginger
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
3 cups cooked long-grain rice
1 cup cooked meat cut in 1/2-inch cubes, such as pork, ham, beef, or chicken
1/2 cup frozen peas, defrosted in a strainer at room temperature

Directions

Put the mushrooms in a small bowl and cover with boiling water and soak until re-hydrated, about 20 minutes. 
Drain, squeeze dry, and cut mushrooms in quarters. 
Set aside.

Heat 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil in a well-seasoned wok or large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. 
Swirl to coat the pan. 
Pour in the eggs, swirl the pan so the egg forms a large thin pancake. 
(Lift the edge of the egg to allow any uncooked egg to run to the center.) 
As soon as the egg has set, turn it out of the pan onto a cutting board. 
Cool, cut into 1 inch pieces.

Wipe out the pan with a paper towel and heat the remaining peanut oil over high heat. 
Add the scallions and carrots and stir-fry for 1 1/2 minutes. 
Add the mushrooms, garlic, chile, and ginger, stir-fry for 1 minute more. 
Add the soy sauce, sesame oil and rice and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes. 
Add the meat, peas, and reserved egg, cook, stirring until heated through, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
Serve immediately.
