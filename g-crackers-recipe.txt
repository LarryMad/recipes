Graham Crackers & Peanut Butter

too many Graham Crackers (honey grahams preferred)
lots of peanut butter

1. Do not preheat anything
2. Remove several of your too many graham crackers from package
3. Spread peanut butter on graham cracker, approximately 1/4-inch thick, evenly across the entirety of the cracker. The smallest of margins around the edge of the cracker may be left, if you prefer, for more secure gripping, and less chance of peanut butter on the fingers.
4. Eat.
