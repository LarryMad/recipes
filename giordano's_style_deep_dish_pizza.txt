Giordano's Style Deep Dish Stuffed Crust Pizza

Made this for the first time on March 12 2016. Generally, felt it was a success, but could use a couple tweeks:

	1. Thinner/less crust
	2. Softer crust
	3. More sauce
	4. (According to Angie) More cheese


I gained from the Giordano's website (which has a page devoted to making this style pizza--without giving away too many of their own secrets), as well as from a blog page, found by Angie, and copied here:  It's My Reality...Really: Chicago Stuffed Pizza

Special equipment

	* 2 (or maybe 3) round cake pans



For the dough
Ingredients:

	* 3 3/4 C      warm water
	* 1/4 C        Canola oil
	* 4 1/2 T      yeast
	* 4 1/2 - 5 C  flour
	* 1 C          corn meal
	* 1 T          salt
	* 3 T          sugar



	1. Mix the yeast into the warm water and oil, and let the yeast proof for several minutes.
	2. Blend 2 Cups of the flour with the corn meal, salt, and sugar.
	3. Add the water/yeast mixture to the flour mixture and mix until well blended.
	4. Add enough of the remaining flour to make the dough tacky. Do not over mix or over knead.
	5. Put the dough into an oiled container, and let it sit at least overnight in the fridge. Punch it down a couple of times. Take it out of the fridge about 2 hours before you'll use it.
	6. Put it on a floured surface, and divide it into two. For each of the two: divide into 1/3 and 2/3 portions.
	7. Roll out a 2/3 portion, to about 15-16 inches diameter, and put it into round cake pan with the rolled-out dough overflowing the top edge by an inch or so. Repeat for the other 2/3 portion, into the other cake pan.
	8. Roll out each of the two 1/3 portions, to about 11 inches diameter. After the ingredients are put into the bottom crust, place the top crust over the ingredients, and pinch the edges of the top and bottom crusts together.


What I think I would change next time:

	* Cut the dough ingredients by about a third...or just cut out a third of the made dough (could use it to make a third pizza).
	* Replace 1/4 C of the water with 1/4 C of Canola oil. (Already adjusted above.)
	* Roll both the top and bottom crusts thinner (which would happen anyway, if I follow the change in the first bullet). The blog post mentioned above says the top crust should be so thin it's almost transparent.



For the sauce
Ingredients:

	* 24 oz      pasta sauce
	* 12 oz      petite diced tomatoes
	* 4 oz       tomato paste
	* 1 tsp      oregano
	* 1 tsp      basil
	* 1 tsp      salt
	* 1/4 C      sugar



	1. Cook it together



For the pizza

	1. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
	2. Bottom crust in the greased pan. (See above for rolling out the dough.)
	3. Ingredients, including a lot of cheese. Between 8 and 16 ounces of cheese. No sauce.
	4. Top crust on top of the ingredients. Pinch the crust edges together so they become one. Cut several small holes in the top crust, for steam to escape and to prevent bubbling.
	5. Put plenty of sauce on top.
	6. Bake for 30 minutes. Check at 20-25 minutes; if the crust is burning, top with some foil.
	7. Remove from the oven and let it set for a few minutes before cutting. Do not use a pizza cutter, as it will smash the pie. Use a sharp bread knife, or maybe another sharp knife.
