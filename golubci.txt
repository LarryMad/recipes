To make meat filling, heat clarified or oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add the onion and fry until soft, about 7 minutes. Place in a bowl with beef and remaining filling ingredients. Mix well to combined.

Core cabbage and place whole in a large pot of boiling salted water. Cook just long enough to soften leaves, about 10-15 minutes. Drain in a colander and cool under cold running water. Carefully remove the leaves.

Cut thick ribs from larger leaves, then halve the leaves; keep smaller leaves intact. You will need 14-16 leaves. Use leaves and trimmings to line a deep saucepan.

To make the rolls, place a generous tablespoon of meet filling at base of each leaf, roll one turn and tuck in sides to contain filling. Roll firmly to end of leaf.

In a saucepan over high heat, bring the stock and tomato sauce to a boil. Add the garlic, lemon juice and salt. Cook for one more minute.

Arrange the rolls in a large pot, pour the sauce over the top. Cover and bring to boil. Place in a oven for about 45-50 minutes.

Serve the rolls hot or warm. Serve with yogurt or sour cream.
