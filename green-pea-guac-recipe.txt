Ingredients:
 - ½ pound fresh sweet peas, shucked (about 1/2 to 2/3 cup peas)
 - 2 small jalapeños
 - 2 tablespoons packed cilantro leaves, chopped, more for garnish
 - ¾ teaspoon salt, more as needed
 - 3 small ripe avocados, mashed
 - 2 scallions, whites only, sliced as thin as possible (about 1/4 cup)
 - Zest of 1 lime
 - Juice of 1 lime, more as needed
 - 1 tablespoon toasted sunflower seeds
 - Flaky sea salt, for serving
 - Tortilla chips, for serving
 - Lime wedges, for serving

Directions:
 1. Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil and prepare a bowl with water 	and ice. Plunge peas into the boiling water and cook until al dente, about 1 	minute. Drain peas and immediately transfer to the ice bath. Drain.

 2. Heat broiler to high and broil one of the jalapeños on a heatproof pan. 	Cook, turning occasionally, until jalapeño is completely charred. Transfer 	to a small bowl, cover tightly in plastic wrap and let sit for 15 minutes. 	When cool enough to handle, use a towel to wipe off the charred skin. 	Halve, seed and devein the roasted jalapeño. Then halve, seed, and mince the 	remaining raw jalapeño.
 
 3. In a blender or the bowl of a food processor, purée peas (reserving 2 	tablespoons for garnish) with roasted jalapeño, minced raw jalapeño, cilantro 	and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Process until almost smooth but still a little 	chunky.
 
 4. In a medium bowl, combine mashed avocado, scallions, lime zest, lime juice, 	remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and the pea purée. Adjust salt and lime juice 	as needed and garnish with fresh peas, sunflower seeds and flaky sea salt. 	Serve with tortilla chips and lime wedges.
