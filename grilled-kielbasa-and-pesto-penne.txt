Grilled Kielbasa and Pesto Penne

Ingredients:
 - 1 lb Penne Pasta
 - 1 lb cooked Kielbasa
 - 1/2 cup Pesto sauce
 - 1 tablespoon dried basil
 - Dash of dried Oregano
 - 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
 - Salt and pepper to taste

Directions:
 1. Preheat the grill or griddle on medium heat.
 2. Cook the pasta according to the directions on the box. Be sure to season 
    the boiling water with salt before adding in the pasta.  
 3. Keep the Kielbasa whole if using an outdoor grill. Cut the Kielbasa into 
    1/2 inch slices if you're using a stovetop griddle. Grill the Kielbasa 
    until slightly browned and marked with grill marks. 
 4. Return the drained pasta to the pot. Toss in the Kielbasa (if you keep the 
    Kielbasa whole, be sure to cut it into slices before adding it to the 
    pasta), Pesto sauce, dried basil, dried Oregano, and garlic powder. 
 5. Toss together the ingredients. 
 6. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
 7. Serve warm.
