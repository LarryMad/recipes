Serves: 2 servings
Ingredients
2 medium peaches, pitted and sliced
2 teaspoons + 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, divided
1 teaspoon honey
6 inches of baguette
2 tablespoons butter, melted
¼ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 cup ripe blueberries
4 ounces cubed fresh mozzarella
1 shallot, peeled and thinly sliced into rings
½ cup fresh basil leaves, torn
Instructions
In a large serving bowl, whisk together 2 teaspoons of olive oil, 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar, and 1 teaspoon honey. Add the peaches and toss well to coat.
Slice the baguette horizontally down the middle (keeping the blade of the knife parallel to the cutting board), then brush each cut side with the melted butter.
Heat a grill pan over medium; place the bread, buttered side down, onto the preheated grill pan and allow to cook for 2 to 3 minutes until nicely toasted. Transfer to a cutting board and slice into bite-sized pieces.
Place the marinated peaches onto the same grill pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes per side until lightly grilled. While the peaches are grilling, add another tablespoon of olive oil, teaspoon of balsamic vinegar, and ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper into the marinating bowl. Whisk well.
Once the peaches are grilled, transfer them back into the large serving bowl. Add the bread pieces, blueberries, mozzarella, shallot, and basil to the bowl. Toss well and serve at once.
