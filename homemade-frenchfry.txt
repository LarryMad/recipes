Ingredients:
   * 1/2 kg potatoes
   * sunflower oil
   * salt

Directions:
   * wash the potatoes thoroughly in water
   * chop the potatoes in as equal lines as possible (approx. 4 x 4 mm in width
     and height)
   * add as much oil to a frying pan so that it's filled with about 5mm of oil
     and set the pan on heat, adding a few of chopped potatoes to the pan
   * when the oil becomes hot enough (when the few potatoes start to fry), add
     all the chopped potatoes to the pan, distribute evenly and salt the whole
     slightly (or to taste), then cover the pan with a lid and lower the heat
   * from time to time, lift the lid and check if the potatoes have been
     steamed to the point that they would break if touched (or if a slight
     pressure is applied to them); if so, proceed to turn the content of the
     pan around, salt them again and remove the lid
   * after about 10 to 15 minutes, check the potatoes again and then increase
     the heath a little (to maybe medium), so that the frying will make the
     fries crispy
   * watch carefully (more regularly), as the fries can get over done quickly
   * when done, serve with sunny side up eggs

Enjoy! :) It's delicious!
