 Hot and Sour Soup (Serves 4-6)  Ingredients:  6 cups Chicken Broth (or one large can Swanson's Chicken Broth) 3 slices Cut up turkey ham (optional: use real ham) 1/2-1/3 pad tofu (firm) 1 tblsp bamboo shoots in chili oil 1 heaping tblsp minced ginger 1 heaping tblsp minced garlic 1 tsp salt (optional) 1 tsp sugar 2 tblspns soy sauce (lite) 3 tblspns red wine vinegar 2-3 tsp cornstarch dissolved in 2 tblspns water 2 eggs, beaten a bunch scallions cut up.  Use green bits for garnish  1. Bring broth to boil -- add soy sauce & vinegar. 2. Cut up ham, tofu, scallions.  Dissolve cornstarch in water. 3. Add ham, tofu, scallions to boiling broth.  Add garlic, ginger, bamboo shoots, salt, sugar.   4. Wait till broth starts to boil again, add cornstarch sparingly and see how much soup thickens.   5. Slowly pour in beaten eggs, stirring broth rapidly in one direction -- eggs should "flower" in long strings and mats.  Let boil another 30-60 seconds, then remove from heat. 6. Garnish with scallion greens.  Note: ingredients suggested but not used in this variation: 2 tblspns cloud ear mushrooms, 2 tblspns dry lily buds (both must be soaked first).  I forgot to add a tblspn of fresh ground pepper.  Other recipes include sesame oil or white pepper, rice wine or rice wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  Result could probably use a little more garlic, but the amount of ginger is about right....
