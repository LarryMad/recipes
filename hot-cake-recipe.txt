Ingredients:
 - 250 grams Plain Flour
 - 1 teaspoons Salt
 - 1 teaspoon Baking Powder
 - 4 whole Egg
 - 2 teaspoons Sugar
 - 2 Tablespoons Butter, Melted
 - 250 milliliters Milk

Directions:
 1. Sift the flour. In a mixing bowl, combine sifted flour, salt and baking powder.

 2. Now take a second bowl. Combine the egg, sugar, melted butter and milk.
    Next, slowly add egg mixture to the flour mixture.

 3. Whisk until the batter is smooth like thin cream. Allow batter to rest 10 minutes.

 4. Next heat a frying pan on medium heat and brush the pan with a little melted butter.
    Pour the batter on the pan using a small ladle about 1/4 cup or 30 ml,
    making a basic pancake that about 5 to 6 inches in diameter.
    Cook both sides until nicely golden brown.

 5. Serve your hot cake with jam or your favorite syrup.
