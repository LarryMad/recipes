You'll need:

	- Water
	- Fire
	- Recipient which can hold the water and is also resilient to high temperatures

Put the water inside the recipient. Put the recipient over the fire. Wait until the water start making some bubbles (it's Pan telling you the water is quite hot).

Now you have hot water. You can do whatever is done to hot water, like trowing it at your neighbour's face when he's complaining about your night's programming over the very loud music you like to hear.
