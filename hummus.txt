Ingredients

    2 cups drained well-cooked or canned chickpeas, liquid reserved
	1/2 cup tahini (sesame paste), optional, with some of its oil
	1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus oil for drizzling
	2 cloves garlic, peeled, or to taste
	Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
	1 tablespoon ground cumin or paprika, or to taste, plus a sprinkling for garnish
	Juice of 1 lemon, plus more as needed
	Chopped fresh parsley leaves for garnish

Preparation

	1. Put everything except the parsley in a food processor and begin to process; add the chickpea liquid or water as needed to allow the machine to produce a smooth puree.

	2. Taste and adjust the seasoning (I often find I like to add much more lemon juice). Serve, drizzled with the olive oil and sprinkled with a bit more cumin or paprika and some parsley.
