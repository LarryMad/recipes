Ingredients:
 - Grape jelly(purple)
 - Creaming Soda jelly(pink)
 - Blueberry jelly(blue)
 - Lime jelly(green)
 - Lemon jelly(yellow)
 - Orange jelly(orange)
 - Raspberry jelly(red)

Directions:
  1. Follow directions to prepare the first jelly colour(purple) in a jug and fill approximately 1/7th of the mould. This doesn’t need to be science, an estimation is fine!
  2. When the first layer is set, prepare the second jelly colour (pink). Pour another 1/7th of the mould over the purple jelly, cover and return to the refrigerator to set.
  3. Repeat this process for each colour, to achieve a ‘true rainbow’ pour the jelly in the colour order listed in the ingredients list.
  4. When the last layer (red) has set completely, remove the lid/cover and place the plate or platter you wish to serve the rainbow on top of the mould, face down. It is a good idea to ensure the plate or platter is approximately 20 per cent wider than the mould.
