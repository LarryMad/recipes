Ingredients:
 - 1 medium onion, chopped
 - 1 clove garlic, minced
 - 96 oz vegetable broth
 - 1.25 gals kale, cut to size (with large vein/stem rmoved)
 - 16 oz frozen mixed vegetables
 - 1-2 lbs chicken, diced, cooked
 - olive or canola oil

Directions:
 1. In a 6 quart pot, saute onions in oil. When soft and brown, add garlic.
    Saute until garlic softens (< 5 minutes).

 2. Add vegetable broth and tun up the heat to bring the mixture to a light
    boil.

 3. While the broth is heating to a boil, add the kale.  Note, the kale will
    need to cook down in order for it to all fit in the covered pot.

 4. Once all of the kale has been added and the mixture has reached a boil,
    reduce heat to simmer (covered for 1 to 2 hrs or until kale is sufficiently
    softened).
 
 5. Add cooked frozen vegetables and chicken.

 6. Simmer for another 1 hour (or your tolereance threshold for cooking soup).

 7. Serve.

    As always, the soup is even better when it is re-heated the next day.
