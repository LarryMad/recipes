Crock Pot Kalua Pork
recipe courtesy of allrecipes

6 lb pork butt roast– I bought bone-in because it was cheaper
1 1/2 T Hawaiian sea salt
1 T liquid smoke flavoring

1. Pierce the roast all over with a carving fork. Rub the salt all over the roast. Then rub the
	liquid smoke all over the roast.
2. Place roast in the crock pot, cover and cook on low for 16 -20 hours (or 8 – 10 hours on
	high), turning once halfway through the cooking time.
3. Remove the roast to cool before shredding (I suppose if you have asbestos hands and can stand 
	the heat, you can shred it immediately). If you would like a less greasy dish, pour the juices from the crock pot into a bowl and stick it in the freezer. By the time you’re done shredding the pork, all the fat should have floated to the top. Discard the fat.
4. Put the shredded pork back in the crock pot and pour the juices back over the meat. Cook an 
	additional 30 minutes to 1 hour on high so the pork can soak up the salty juice. Alternatively, I suppose you could serve the shredded pork as is with the juice on the side, but I don’t think it would taste as good.
5. Serve with hot rice and mac salad.
