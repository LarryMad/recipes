INGREDIENTS
12 oz. Korean buckwheat noodles
1 12-oz. jar napa kimchi
2 tablespoons (or more) rice wine vinegar
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
1 tablespoon (or more) sugar
Kosher salt
2 large eggs, hardboiled, quartered
½ hot house cucumber, julienned
4 scallions, thinly sliced
½ cup thinly sliced toasted laver or nori sheets
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds

RECIPE PREPARATION
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, but still slightly bouncy, about 1½ minutes. Drain and rinse under cold running water; set aside.

Drain kimchi, reserving liquid; chop kimchi. Combine kimchi, kimchi liquid, vinegar, oil, and sugar in a large bowl and mix to combine. Add noodles and toss to coat; season with salt and more vinegar or sugar, if desired.

Serve topped with egg, cucumber, scallions, laver, sesame seeds, and 2 cups crushed ice.

DO AHEAD: Kimchi dressing can be made 2 days ahead. Cover and chill.
