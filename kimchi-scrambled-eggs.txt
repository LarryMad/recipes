Ingredients:
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp milk or soy milk
- 1/2 cup kimchi ? drained
- 1 tsp canola oil or butter for frying

Directions:
- Heat your pan at just over medium temperature, and lubricate with the oil or butter.

- While the pan is heating, crack eggs into a bowl and add milk. Whisk until combined. Add the kimchi to the egg mixture in order to coat all of the kimchi. The kimchi should be drained of liquid so that your scrambled eggs are not watery.

- Pop everything into the pan and fry.
