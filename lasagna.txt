2 cloves garlic, minced
1 28-ounce can good quality tomato sauce
3 ounces (half a 6-oz can) tomato paste
1 14-ounce can crushed tomatoes
2 Tbsp chopped fresh oregano or 2 teaspoons dried oregano

Lasagna:
1/2 lb dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)
15 ounces Ricotta cheese
1 1/2 lb (24 ounces) Mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced
1/4 lb (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese
Cooking Utensils You'll Need:
A large skillet to brown the beef, bell pepper, and onion
A large pot (8 to 12-quarts) for cooking the pasta
A medium sized pot (3 to 4 quarts) to simmer the sauce
13" x 9" x 2" lasagna pan, preferably pyrex or stainless steel (avoid aluminum pans if you can, they can react with the acidity of the sauce)
A large colander to drain the noodles
A couple large sheet pans to cool the noodles
A large slotted cooking spoon
A large wooden cooking spoon
A chef's knife or large paring knife to cut the vegetables

 
Method
1 Put pasta water on to boil: Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.
2 Brown the ground beef: In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook it until it is lightly browned on all sides.
