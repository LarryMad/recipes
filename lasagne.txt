Then one layer of pasta, one layer of besciamella, meat sauce,

Ragu' di carne alla Bolognese
===== == ===== ==== =========

This ragu' can also be used to make other kinds of pasta, 
like penne, maccheroni, spaghetti, linguine, etc. 
The pasta does not need to be fresh. Just cook the pasta
in salty, boiling water as much as required, then add 
this ragu' sauce in the desired quantity. Sprinkle with 
freshly grated parmesan.

Ingredients

One medium-sized onion (preferably red)
Parsley (preferably flat, not curly)
one medium carrot
celery, 6 inch 
4 cloves of garlic
olive oil
one pound of ground beef 
one or two large tablets of boullion (beef)
one or two cans of peeled tomatos (800 grams)
a small can of tomato paste
4 cloves (optional)
one or two dried bay leaves (optional)
half a nutmeg grated (optional)
lemon peel (optional)
half a glass of dry white wine (optional)
fresh basil leaves (optional)

Preparation

Finely chop onion, parsley, carrot, celery, and garlic.  
Heat in pan with olive oil until golden.

Add meat and tablet(s) of boullion and brown this for about 10-15
minutes.  Add also ground nutmeg, cloves, and the bay leaves if desided.

Add peeled tomatoes (only the tomatoes, not the juice of the can).  
Cook for one or two hours covered or partly uncovered.  
when the tomatoes are melted with the sauce and their juice has 
been mostly absorbed, add the tomato paste. Add also the wine and
the lemon peel if desired. Let it cook for about 20 minutes still, 
stearing with a wooden spoon every once in a while. 
At the end, add basil leaves if desired and some salt if needed.
