Ingridients:
3 cups all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons baking powder 
1 teaspoon salt 
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 
1 cup butter flavored shortening 
2 cups white sugar
3 eggs 1/2 cup sour cream
Daisy Sour Cream Regular 
1 1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract 
1 1/4 teaspoons lemon extract 
1 cup milk

Directions:
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the shortening and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the sour cream, vanilla
 and lemon extract. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing just until incorporated. Pour batter into prepared pan.
Bake in the preheated oven for 45 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 
minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely.
