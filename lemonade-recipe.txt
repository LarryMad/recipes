Ingredients:
 - 1 cup sugar
 - 5 cups water, divided
 - 6 to 8 lemons (about 1 cup of lemon juice)
 - Ice

Directions:

1. Make the simple syrup. Combine the sugar and 1 cup of the water in a small
	saucepan and bring to a gentle simmer over low heat to dissolve sugar. Once
	the sugar is completely dissolved, remove from heat to cool.
	
2. Squeeze the lemons. Roll each lemon over your cutting board, pressing down as you do.
	This will help them to release their juice. Cut in half and squeeze. Repeat until
	you have one cup. You might not need all the lemons, but try to save at least one
	half if you want to garnish your glasses.
	
3. Combine. Add the cooled syrup to your pitcher, followed by the lemon juice and
	remaining 4 cups of water. Stir, taste, and adjust; add a few tablespoons of sugar
	if it needs to be sweeter or the juice of 1/2 lemon if it needs more tartness.
	
4. Add ice. Add ice to pitcher if you think you will drink the whole pitcher right away.
	Otherwise add ice to each glass.
