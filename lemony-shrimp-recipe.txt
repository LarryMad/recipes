1. Combine the brown rice and water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce
heat to low and cook until all the water is absorbed, about 25 minutes.

2. Melt the butter with the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the 
garlic in the butter and oil until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in the wine 
and lemon juice; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer. Stir in the shrimp and 
cook until the shrimp turns pink, stirring regularly, 5 to 7 minutes. Sprinkle 
the parsley over the shrimp and cook another 2 minutes. Add the cornstarch to 
the liquid and stir until it thickens, about 1 minute more. Serve hot over the 
brown rice.
