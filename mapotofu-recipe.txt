Ingredients

	- 1 pound regular tofu (tender ones)
	- 1/2 cup minced meat-beef or pork
	- 1 and 1/2 tablespoons Doubanjiang
	- 1 teaspoon fermented black beans(also known as dou-chi and fermented soya beans)
	- 1/2 teaspoon salt for soaking the tofu cubes
	- 1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorn or peppercorn powder
	- 1/2 tablespoon light soy sauce
	- 1/2 cup of water or broth
	- 2 tablespoons cooking oil
	- 1 tablespoon rice wine
	- 3 spring onions, finely chopped

	- 2 garlic cloves,finely chopped
	Water starch

Directions:

	1. Cut tofu into square cubes (around 2cms). Prepare a container; pour some water with a little amount of salt. Then put the tofu cubes in to soak for about 10 minutes. Move out and drain.

	2. Get a wok and heat up around 1 tablespoon of oil for about 1 minute, fry the minced meat until almost cooked. Transfer out.

	3. Heat up another tablespoon of oil over medium fire; fry doubanjiang, garlic and fermented black beans until you can smell the aroma.

	4. Turn up the fire and add tofu cubes in. Add around 1/2 cup of water or broth,rice wine and soy sauce. Wait for boiling. Taste the dish at this step to see whether any extra salt is needed.

	5. Stir the water starch in. Simmer around 2 minutes with high fire until the sauce is thickened. Mix fried minced meat and some of the green onions.

	6. Transfer all the content to the serving plate. Garnish the rest of chopped spring onions on top and Sichuan peppercorn powder if you want.
