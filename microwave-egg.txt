Cook a perfect microwave egg in 2 minutes without special gear - unless you consider a paper coffee cup and a fork special, that is. Never fails, always moist and delicious. Why compromise?

Years of experimentation from college dorm living, to bachelor pad, to road-warrior have perfected this egg-tech.

Spray or butter a paper coffee cup, slap in an egg and some water, microwave 1 minute at 30 percent power, inspect and nuke it again.

Serve with your choice of condiments, salt, pepper, spices, hot sauce, jam, ketchup.
