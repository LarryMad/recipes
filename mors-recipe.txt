Ingredients:

700 grams cranberries
1 cup sugar
3 liters water

Preparation:

Place the cranberries in a blender and blend until smooth. Then, filter the mix through a sieve, ideally a fine mesh strainer. Remove the juice from mix and keep it cold. (This will be added back to the mixture at a later stage).

Place the contents from the sieve in a large saucepan and add three liters of hot water.

Boil 7 minutes.

Then filter and throw out the cranberry skins.

Add the sugar to the mix and bring to a boil until the sugar dissolves. Then, let the mixture cool until it is warm to the touch (not more than 35 degrees). After that, mix in the juice from earlier. Cool so that the juice does not lose vitamins before mixing.
