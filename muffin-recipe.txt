Ingredients:
1 (12 ounce) package English muffins
6 eggs
1/4 cup chopped green onion
1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
2 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
6 ounces ground breakfast sausage

Direction:
 1. Split the muffins open with a fork and toast them in a 
	toaster oven.
	
 2. In a large bowl scramble the eggs, green onions and cheddar
	cheese together. Heat vegetable oil in a skillet, pour the 
	egg mixture into the skillet and let it fry in one layer as 
	you would an omelet. When the egg is cooked on the underside,
	flip the egg over and cook the wet side; remove from heat 
	when cooked through.
	
 3. At the same time that the eggs are frying, form the sausage 
	into small patties. Place the sausage in another skillet. 
	Fry until browned, remove from pan and drain on paper towels.
	
 4. Make the muffin sandwiches by layering a piece of sausage and
	a piece of the fried egg between the two muffin pieces. If 
	you intend to freeze the sandwiches, let each part of the 
	sandwich cool before make the sandwiches, then wrap them in 
	plastic wrap and freeze. Reheat in the microwave.
