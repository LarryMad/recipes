Ingredients
2 medium eggs
125ml canola oil
250ml semi-skimmed milk

250g golden caster sugar
400g self-raising flour (or same quantity plain flour and 3 tsp baking powder)
1 tsp salt
100g chocolate chips or dried fruit such as sultanas or dried cherries (optional)


1.Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Line 2 muffin trays with paper muffin cases. In a large bowl beat the eggs lightly with a handheld electric mixer for 1 min. Add the oil and milk and beat until just combined then add the sugar and whisk until you have a smooth batter.

2. Sift in the flour and salt (and baking powder if using) then mix until just smooth. Be careful not to over-mix the batter as this will make the muffins tough. Stir in the chocolate chips or dried fruit if using.

3. Fill muffin cases two-thirds full and bake for 20-25 mins, until risen, firm to the touch and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. If the trays will not fit on 1 shelf, swap the shelves around after 15 mins of cooking.

4. Leave the muffins in the tin to cool for a few mins and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
