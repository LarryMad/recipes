MULLED WINE
Spiced mulled wine is a winter favorite -- warm, flavorful, and always so comforting!

PREP TIME: 5 MINS COOK TIME: 15 MINS TOTAL TIME: 20 MINS
INGREDIENTS:

1 (750 ml) bottle of dry red wine
1 orange, sliced into rounds
1/4 cup brandy (optional)
1/4 cup honey or sugar
8 whole cloves
2 cinnamon sticks
2 star anise
optional garnishes: citrus slices (orange, lemon and/or lime), extra cinnamon sticks, extra star anise
DIRECTIONS:

Combine all ingredients in a non-aluminum saucepan, and bring to a simmer (not a boil -- you don't want to boil the alcohol out!) over medium-high heat.  Reduce heat to medium-low, and let the wine simmer for at least 15 minutes or up to 3 hours. Strain, and serve warm with your desired garnishes.

*You can also place the oranges, cloves, cinnamon, and star anise in a cheesecloth. Then simply strain and pull out the bundle when ready to serve.
