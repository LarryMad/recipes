Ingredients:
1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms, such as shiitake, oyster, morel, or porcini
1 cup sliced fennel bulb
2 medium zucchini, sliced into matchsticks
1/2 teaspoon fennel seed, crushed
1 tablespoon olive oil
2/3 cup Arborio or medium-grain rice
2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to season
1/8 teaspoon pepper
1/3 cup thinly sliced green onion
1 tablespoon snipped fennel leaves
1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional)
Fennel leaves (optional) - 1/2 cup butter


Directions:
1. In a medium saucepan cook mushrooms, sliced fennel bulb, zucchini, and fennel seed in hot olive oil until tender. Stir in uncooked Arborio or medium-grain rice. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more.

2. Carefully stir in broth, salt, and pepper. Bring to boiling; reduce heat. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes (do not lift cover).

3. Remove from heat. Stir in zucchini and green onion. Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. The rice should be tender but slightly firm, and the mixture should be creamy. If necessary, stir in a little water to reach the desired consistency.

4. Stir in snipped fennel leaves and fold in Parmesan cheese. If desired, garnish risotto with additional fennel leaves.
