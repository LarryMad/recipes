Ingredients

    1/4 cup olive oil
    3 lb pork, baby back ribs
    Vinegar based marinade
    5 cloves garlic or 2 tsp dried garlic
    1 tsp chili flakes
    1/2 tsp white pepper, ground
    1 tbsp salt, ground sea or Kosher salt
    1 tbsp mustard, dried
    1/2 tbsp oregano, dried
    1/2 tbsp cumin, ground
    2 tbsp paprika
    1 cup apple cider vinegar

 Instructions

    Brush the olive oil across all surfaces of the pork baby back ribs and place in a flat container that will fit in your refrigerator. Place all marinade ingredients in a bowl and stir well to combine. Using your hands, rub the marinade into the ribs, cover your container and refrigerate for 24 hours if you can.

    1 hour before cooking, remove the ribs from the refrigerator to allow to come to room temperature. Meanwhile, if using a BBQ smoker, soak your wood chips and prepare your smoker using the manufacturer's instructions. Set the temperature to 220 Fahrenheit or 105 Celsius. Alternatively set your oven to the same temperature. Place the ribs in the smoker or oven and cook for 6 hours. Brush any leftover marinade over the ribs from time to time.

    Serve the ribs with plenty of coleslaw or potato salad. Corn on the cob also goes well.
