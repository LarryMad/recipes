Onigiri

1 cup rice
1/4 cup rice vinegar
2 tsp sugar
1 pinch of salt

1 sheet nori
1 can tuna
1 egg
japanese mayonnaise (kewpie brand or similar)

Cook rice, hard boil the egg
Chop egg
Mix tuna with about 1/2 tbsp of mayonnaise (or more if you love mayonnaise)
Cut the sheet of nori in 2 (unless you already have the half sheets)

Mix the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt into the rice, using a cutting motion to avoid "squishing" the rice

Put 1/4 of the rice on a sheet of plastic wrap. Top with 1/2 of the tuna and 1/2 of the chopped egg.
Cover with 1/4 of the rice. The goal is to encircle the tuna/egg with the rice.

Lift the sides of the plastic wrap to form a cocoon around the rice - this allows us to compact the rice
into a ball. Squeeze tightly and then use a hard surface (a book works well) to form the rice into a triangle.

Remove the triangular rice and place on a half sheet of nori, with a triangle tip aligning with the
top of the nori sheet. Fold up the bottom half of the nori sheet over the top so the rice triangle
is wrapped in the nori. Fold the sides in a way that makes sense.

Bam, done. Maybe eat with a little soy sauce.
