Ingredients:
- 1 3/4 cup milk
- 2 eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla essence
- 2 cups self-raising flour
- 1/3 cup caster sugar

Directions:
1. Whisk milk, eggs and vanilla together in a jug. Sift flour into a large bowl. Stir in sugar. Make a well in the centre. Add milk mixture. Whisk until just combined.
2. Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Spray with cooking oil. Using 1/4 cup mixture per pancake, cook 2 pancakes for 2 minutes or until bubbles appear on surface. Turn and cook for a further 1-2 minutes or until cooked through. Transfer to a plate. Cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining mixture, spraying pan with cooking oil between batches.
