Basic pancakes
1 Cup all-purpose flour
1 Tbsp sugar
1/3 tsp salt
3 tsp baking powder
3/4 cup milk
2 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 egg

In a bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder and blend together.
In another bowl or large jug, combine the milk, egg and oil and mix well.
Add half of the milk/egg mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until most of the liquid is absorbed.
Add remaining liquid to bowl and mix well until smooth.
If too wet/dry, add a Tbsp of flour/milk to reach desired consistency (~ cheap ketchup)

Heat griddle to 325 or skillet to medium heat.
Add butter to lightly coat cooking surface.
Spoon mixture in approx. 1/4 cup measures onto cooking surface.
Once about half the bubbles have popped on upper side of pancake have burst, flip and cook other side for an additional couple of minutes.
Peeking at the underside to check done-ness is allowed.

Once cooked, spread with jam, preserves, or drench in maple syrup as desired.

Feel free to vary flour mixture to use 3/4 cup all-purpose flour and 1/4 of any/all of wholewheat flour, almond flour, corn flour, etc.
Experiment but keep the majority of the flour as wheat flour to ensure the pancakes don't break apart.
