Ingredients:
	1/4 cup good quality extra-virgin olive oil
	1 1/2 medium sweet onions, cut into medium dice
	1 large head cauliflower, cut into medium florets
	2 cloves garlic, minced
	1 pound rigatoni, cooked al dente
	3/4 cup Italian bread crumbs
	1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
	Salt and freshly ground black pepper
	Serving suggestion: loaf of Italian bread with butter

Directions:

In a large nonstick, deep-sided saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saute until just starting to get soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the cauliflower and stir well. Cover and lower the heat, letting the cauliflower steam until almost fork-tender, about 5 minutes. Remove the cover; raise the heat to medium to evaporate most of the cooking liquid. Add a splash more olive oil and the garlic and brown over medium-high heat until the cauliflower is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add the pasta and toss together to combine.

Add the bread crumbs and cheese and stir well to coat, slightly browning the crumbs, about 2 minutes.

Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add more cheese, if desired. Serve with crusty Italian bread and butter.
