Ingredients:
- 400g pork mince
- 1 small onion, grated
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed
- zest ½ lemon
- 50g grated parmesan
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 400g spaghetti
- 150ml double cream
- 200g fresh or frozen peas, defrosted if frozen
- handful parsley, roughly chopped

Directions:
- Mix the mince, onion, garlic and zest with half the Parmesan and some seasoning, 
then shape into 16 walnut-sized meatballs. 
Heat the oil in a non-stick pan and fry the meatballs for 10-12 mins until golden.

- Meanwhile, cook the pasta following pack instructions, drain and reserve 150ml of 
the cooking liquid. Add the cream and 100ml pasta water to the meatballs, scraping 
the bottom of the pan to get all the sticky bits off. Bubble until thick and 
the meatballs are cooked through.

- Add the peas, cook for a further 2 mins, then add the parsley. Stir through the 
pasta with a splash more pasta water to make the whole thing saucy. 
Sprinkle over the remaining Parmesan and serve.
