INGREDIENTS
400g dried curly fettuccine pasta
250g rindless bacon rashers, thinly sliced
40g butter
400g cup mushrooms, thinly sliced
5 shallots, ends trimmed, thinly sliced
425ml pouring cream
30g (1/3 cup) shredded parmesan
30g (1/3 cup) shredded romano
Parmesan (optional), extra, to serve

METHOD
Step 1
Cook the pasta in a large saucepan of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain.
Step 2
Meanwhile, cook the bacon in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat, stirring often, for 4 minutes or until golden. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a plate.
Step 3
Heat the butter in the frying pan. Add the mushroom and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes or until tender and the liquid has reduced.
Step 4
Add the pale section of the shallot and stir to combine. Stir in the bacon and cream. Simmer for 6-7 minutes or until the mixture thickens slightly. Add the parmesan and romano, and stir until well combined.
Step 5
Add the pasta and green section of the shallot to the sauce. Season with salt and pepper and toss until well combined. Divide the pasta among serving dishes. Top with extra parmesan.
