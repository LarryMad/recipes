ingredients

	 -peanut butter (or any other sandwich spread)
	 -jelly         (or any other other sandwich spread)
2 slices -bread    

1. layout the bread side by side (inside down if you're using end pieces)
2. spread peanut butter on the left slice
3. spread the jelly on the right slice (be sure to clean the spreading mechanism 
before inserting it in the jelly jar)
4. place the two slices together. 
5. enjoy!


in place of either the peanut butter or the jelly try:

-apple butter
-mayonnaise
-Gulden's mustard (not the yellow stuff)
-nutella
-other nut butters
-butter
-fluff

-try adding bananas or pickles or potato chips too!
