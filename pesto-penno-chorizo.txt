Pesto Pasta w/ Chorrizo

1. Boil 1.5 liters of water in a cooking pot

2. Add the pasta (I like Penne) and cook until you like it (usually 7-9 mins taste
around those times to make sure it's to your liking)

3. Cut chorrizo in round shapes than cut those round shapes in quarters. The important
part here is to cut them at a shape that you'll like tasting and most importantly
all the same size for better cooking.

4. start cooking the chorrizo in frying pan without any oil (the grease from the chorrizo
will do the trick) Cook until you like the aspect and smell.

5. Drain the water from the Pasta, add the pesto sauce and the chorrizo and serve !
