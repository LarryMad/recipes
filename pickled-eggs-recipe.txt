Pickled Eggs and Beets
(I know it probably sounds strange if you didn't grow up
eating these, but I love them. Also they are a lovely dark 
pink color!)

Ingredients:
8 eggs
1 (15 ounce) can of whole small beets (you can slice them if you wish)
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup water
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (more or less to taste.)

Makes 8 servings (unless you eat more than one egg!)

Directions:
1.  Place eggs in saucepan and bring to a boil.
	Remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand
	for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water,
	cool and peel. I don't know an easy way to peel them.
	Place eggs in a glass jar or plastic container 
	that you don't mind turning pink.
	
2. 	In a saucepan combine beets, vinegar, sugar, water
	and cinnamon (cloves and bay are optional too, but I don't 
	use them.) Bring to a boil and stir until sugar is
	dissolved. Pour the mixture over the eggs in the
	glass jar. Cover and chill overnight - the longer
	you let it chill, the more vibrant the color of
	the eggs will be.
	
Note: Don't use a metal container.
