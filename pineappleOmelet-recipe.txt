Pineapple Omelet

(4 servings)   
4 large eggs
1 Tablespoon milk
1 Tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon lemon zest
1/2 teaspoon salt

For Filling:
1 small can of crushed pineapple - drained
1/3 cup Rum
2 Tablespoons sweet butter
1 Tablespoon apricot jam

For Topping:
powdered sugar
First, prepare the filling by stirring together the pineapple, rum, sweet butter and jam in a small bowl.

In a medium bowl, beat the eggs with the milk, sugar, lemon zest and salt until frothy.

Place a frying pan over medium-high heat and spray generously with cooking spray.

Pour 1/4 of the egg mixture into the pan. As the egg begins to set, lift the edges with a spatula so uncooked egg can flow beneath. When the egg is completely set, spoon 1/4 of the topping mixture over one side of the omelet. Gently fold the omelet and transfer to a serving plate.

Repeat the last step for the remaining three omelets using additional cooking spray as needed.

Top each serving with a sprinkle of powdered sugar.

To have all of the omelets ready at the same time, use oven safe serving plates and place completed omelets in the oven set to 250 degrees.


I don't know why fruity omelets aren't more popular. It's a real fun change of pace for breakfast. By the way, if you don't have sweet butter, softened margarine with a couple of pinches of powdered sugar mixed in makes a good replacement.

Mr Breakfast would like to thank lizabeth for this recipe.
