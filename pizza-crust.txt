##Pizza Crust##

**Ingredients:**
* 3	Cups		Flour
* 1	Cup 		Warm Water
* 1	Tblspn		Olive Oil
* 1/2	Tsspn		Salt
* 2 1/4	Tsspn		Yeast

**Oven**
* Oven to 375Â°
* 8-12 minutes (depends on type of flour, thickness of crust, and environmental factors such as humidity and temperature)

**TIP:** I also like to add basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme, parsley, and parmesan directly into the dough _before_ adding water to the mix.
