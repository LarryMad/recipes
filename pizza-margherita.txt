Ingredients
300g strong bread flour
1 tsp instant yeast (from a sachet or a tub)
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
100ml passata
handful fresh basil or 1 tsp dried
1 garlic clove, crushed
125g ball mozzarella, sliced
handful grated or shaved parmesan
handful cherry tomatoes, halved
handful basil leaves (optional)

Directions:

1. Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. 
Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a 
wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured 
surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. 
You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust. 


2. Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to 
taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
 

3. Roll out the dough: If you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then 
split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, 
about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will 
rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets. 


4. Top and bake: Heat oven to 240C/fan 220C /gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an 
upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the 
back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. 
Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake 
for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if 
using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
