Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt.
Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft,

Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like,
but itâ€™s not essential for a thin crust.
