now in english,

by reasons of understanding and range


my personal future plans within the ethereum network structures

learning to use swarm
learning to write contracts
learning to master parity programm code to further individual needs and wishes

transfering knowledge to a wider group of persons 

woman/ female persons 
willing to learn
willing to introduce themselfes into the world of ethereum
building a female userbase
help building a female supportnet
help building an international oriented supportnet
building up a paid female parity.ethereum.helpcenter

the idea of building a female userbase came up
as i tried to introduce a group of 
women when i was asked what could be the follow up to bitcoin.
whereas i never had to do with bitcoin as an owner or node runner,
i could tell them about ether and its possibilities.

this group made me thinking about women as users,
womens as crypto.currency.users,
and their ways of helping and solving issues 
which differs to male support in a better manner.

so it is us to make things better
