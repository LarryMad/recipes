Heat water in a broad pan until simmering (gentle boiling).
Add vinegar.
Crack the egg open and put it in a ramekin or cup.
Stir the water like creating a whirlpool.
Drop the egg into the water with a fluid movement (get the ramekin as close to the water as you can).
Let it cook for 3/4 minutes.
Remove it with a holed spoon and dry it in a cloth or paper towel.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Enjoy!
