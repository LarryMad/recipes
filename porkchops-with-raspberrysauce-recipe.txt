Ingredients:
 - 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, crushed
 - 1/2 teaspoon dried sage, crushed
 - 1/4 teaspoon salt
 - 1/4 teaspoon pepper
 - 4 ounce boneless pork loin chops
 - 1 tablespoon butter
 - 1 tablespoon olive oil
 - 1/4 cup seedless raspberry jam
 - 2 tablespoons orange juice
 - 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
 - 4 sprigs fresh thyme (optional)

Directions:
 1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). In a small bowl,
    combine crushed thyme, sage, salt, and pepper. Rub evenly over 
    pork chops.

 2. Melt butter and olive oil in a nonstick skillet. Cook pork chops
    for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, turning once. Remove from skillet
    and keep warm in preheated oven.

 3. In the skillet, combine raspberry jam, orange juice, and vinegar. 
    Bring to a boil, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until sauce is 
    reduced to desired consistency (sauce will thicken as it cools). 
    Spoon sauce in a pool onto a serving plate, and top with pork chops. 
    Garnish with sprigs of thyme.
