Ingredients:
 - 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 
 - 3 1/2 pounds beef chuck pot roast 
 - 2 teaspoons salt 
 - 1 teaspoon ground black pepper 
 - 1 cup diced carrots 
 - 1 cup diced celery 
 - 1 cup diced onion 
 - 1/4 cup butter 
 - 1 teaspoon dried rosemary 

Directions:
1. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).

2. Pour vegetable oil into a large oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. 
   Season the chuck roast with salt and black pepper. Brown the meat on 
   both sides in the hot oil, and transfer to a plate.

3. Stir carrots, celery, and onion into the pot, and cook and stir until 
   vegetables start to release their juices, about 3 minutes; loosen any 
   brown flavor bits on the bottom of the pot. Add butter, and cook until 
   the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Then sprinkle in rosemary, 
   stir the vegetables, and return the roast to the pot. Cover the pot with 
   a lid.

4. Roast in the preheated oven until the chuck roast is tender, about 2 1/2 
   to 3 hours. Season vegetables with additional salt and black pepper, if 
   desired.
