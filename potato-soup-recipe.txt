INGREDIENTS:
 - 5 slices bacon, diced
 - 3 tablespoons bacon grease (reserved) or butter
 - 1 cup diced white or yellow onion
 - 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
 - 2 cups chicken stock
 - 2 cups milk, warmed
 - 1.5 pounds potatoes, peeled (if desired) and diced (I recommend Yukon gold potatoes)
 - 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
 - 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt or sour cream
 - 1 teaspoon Kosher salt, or more to taste
 - 1/2 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper
 - optional toppings: thinly-sliced green onions or chives, extra shredded cheese, extra bacon, sour cream

Directions:

 1. Heat a large stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add diced bacon and cook 
	until crispy, stirring occasionally.  Transfer the bacon to a separate 
	plate, using a slotted spoon, reserving about 3 tablespoons of bacon 
	grease in the stockpot.  (Discard any extra grease, or you can substitute 
	butter in place of the 3 tablespoons of bacon grease.  Also, if you are 
	short on time, you can dice the potatoes and onion while the bacon cooks to save time.)

 2. Add onion and saute for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft.  
 	Sprinkle the flour on top of the onion, and stir until combined.  
 	Saute for an additional minute to cook the flour, stirring occasionally.  
 	Then stir in the chicken stock until combined.  Stir in the milk and potatoes 
 	until combined.  Continue cooking until the mixture reaches a simmer, but is
 	not boiling.

 3. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for about 10-15 minutes or 
 	until the potatoes are soft, stirring occasionally every few minutes so 
 	that the bottom does not burn.  (The smaller you dice your potatoes, the 
 	faster they will cook.)

 4. When the potatoes are soft, stir in the cheddar cheese and Greek yogurt 
 	(or sour cream), salt, pepper and cooked bacon bits.  Taste and see if 
 	it needs more salt or pepper or cheese.

 5. Serve warm, garnished with desired toppings.  Or, transfer to a sealed 
 	container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.
