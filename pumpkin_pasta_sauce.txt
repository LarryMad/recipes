dice a medium sized onion and cook in saucepan over medium heat.

as onion is cooking slice 5 cloves of garlic & cube roughly 2 cups of pumpkin or squash.

once the onion is softened add the garlic and allow to cook for a few short minutes. 

when the garlic is fragrant add the 2 cups of cubed pumpkin/squash and add salt.

then add 1 cup of chicken broth and simmer until pumpkin is complete cooked (you can add more broth if necessary, but remember you dont want it to thin in the end and you can always add more broth later)

add one sprig oh thyme to add a little fragrance.

once the veg is completely cooked take out the thyme. use an immersion blender to make it silky smooth. add a tbsp of butter and 1/2 cup of parmesean, romano, or a mixture of both. serve over hot pasta
