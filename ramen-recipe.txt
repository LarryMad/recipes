Ingredients:

4 slices bacon, chopped
1 (1-inch) piece of fresh ginger, peeled and sliced
3 garlic cloves, sliced
1 tablespoon minced lemongrass
1 tablespoon white miso paste (or more to taste)
Red pepper flakes, to taste (I used about ½ teaspoon)
4 cups low-sodium chicken broth
2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce (or to taste – the miso already adds quite a bit of salt)
½ tablespoon balsamic vinegar
½ tablespoon rice wine vinegar
2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
1 package dried ramen noodles (discard the included seasoning packet)
2 cups stemmed and chopped baby spinach leaves
1 shallot, very thinly sliced
2 soft-boiled eggs, peeled and halved
Chopped scallions

Directions:

1. Place a pot over medium-high heat and add the bacon. Render until crispy. Remove half of the bacon with slotted spoon and set aside (this will be used as a garnish).
2. To the remaining bacon and drippings, add the ginger, garlic, and lemongrass and sauté for 1 minute. Add the miso paste and red pepper flakes and stir until incorporated. Add the stock and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 30 minutes and then strain out and discard the aromatics (bacon, garlic, ginger, and lemongrass). Stir in the soy sauce, vinegars, and toasted sesame oil and keep warm until ready to serve.
3. Make the soft-boiled eggs at this point but do not drain the water when finished. Instead, return the water to a simmer and cook the ramen noodles for 2-3 minutes or until tender. Drain, rinse, and set aside.
4. To serve, divide the baby spinach, shallot, and the cooked noodles between two bowls. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and top each bowl with the crisped bacon, soft-boiled eggs, scallions, and hot sauce. Serve immediately.
