preperation of the stuffing:
---------------------------------
Preperation of the sponge mixture:
1.) Dab the cake-pan with margarine.
2.) Besprinkle gapless the cake-pan  with flour.
3.) Mix the margarine in a mixing bowl flexible (or ductile).
4.) Mix the sugar, the cocoa powder and
    the vanilla sugar. Then stir in little by little these ingredients,
    till you gut a concretion or a compact mass.
5.) Stir in the eggs.
6.) Stir in the redwine.
7.) Mixt the four and the baking-powder and stir it in.
8.) Stir in the chocolate streusel.

baking time:
---------------------------------
Top heat/bottom heat: about 356 °F (not preheated)
Hot air:              about 320 °F (not preheated)
Gaz:                  about degree 3 (in Germany, not preheated)
baking time about 45 minutes ( it can vary in length depending on the oven)

test:
---------------------------------
For security reasons make after 40 minutes a test.
Prick a skewer made of wood into the dough.
Glue small nubs at the stick.          --> Then it is not ready.
No nub, only the chocolate is blurred. --> It is ready.
Power down the oven. Let the cake 5 minutes in the oven.
Detach the cake from the rims of the cake pane carefully with the
wooden stick. (Wait a little, more than 15 minutes, if it is hot it can break)
Let the cake cooling-down on a cooling rack.

preperation of the glaze:
---------------------------------
Make the coating in small pieces and put it into a
fire-resistant bowl of glas. Heat the bowl in a water bath
(for example a small pot with water). The water should not
touch the chocolate. Put the melted chocolate on the cake
and make a smooth surface with a knife.

I wish a good success, appetite and many lovely company.
