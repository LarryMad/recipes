Ingredients:
 - Measuring cup
 - Water
 - Saucepan with lid
 - Salt
 - Rice
 - Wooden spoon
 - Fork

Directions:
  1. Boil water and add salt
  2. Pour water (for every cup of rice, use 1¾ cups of water) into a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid. Bring to a boil. Mix 1 teaspoon 	   salt into the water.
  3. Pour in rice
  4. Add it to the boiling water.
  5. Stir once, or just enough to separate the rice
  6. Use a wooden spoon to separate any clumps. Don’t over-stir: That can cause the rice to become sticky.
  7. Cover the pot and simmer
  8. Be sure the lid fits tightly on the pot. Turn down the heat to its lowest setting. Let rice simmer for about 18 minutes, 
     then remove from heat and allow the rice to steam in the pot for another 5 minutes.
  9. Fluff rice with a fork
  10.Just before serving, gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains.

Tip: 
 Don’t uncover the saucepan or stir the rice during cooking. If it’s done before you’re ready to serve it, place a folded towel over the saucepan, replace the lid, and set aside. The towel will absorb excess moisture and condensation, helping prevent overcooked and mushy rice.
