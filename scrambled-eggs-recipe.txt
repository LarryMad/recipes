Ingredients:
- 2 eggs
- butter
- Himalayan pink salt
- dried herbs mix (any kind you like)
- grounded white pepper
- ham
- grated parmesan cheese

Directions:
1. Slice the ham in thin strips
2. Put some butter on a small non-sticky frying pan
3. Heat it up
4. break the 2 eggs into the pan
5. pour the pink salt (to taste), the herbs mix (just a hint) and
   the white pepper (just a hint)
7. scramble the eggs a bit and mix the sliced ham
8. scramble every now and then until the eggs get consistent
9. pour the grated parmesan and scramble a bit more

Make sure to turn the heat off and remove the eggs from the pan before they
cook too much. The yolk should be still strong yellow, before fully cooked.
