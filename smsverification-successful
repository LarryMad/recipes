hey, some good news on tests of functionality

even sms verification worked fine for me.

within 10 minutes completely documented run-through.

exactly as described, 
that is what i like- 
proof piture being posted as well.

now after 3 days of intensense testing i cannot find other
user-side upcoming questions concerning stable operating-
as anyone is interested into the stability tests of the last 4 days i come personally to the opinion
that parity is still usable.
as i keep in my mind that some of the contracts just operate like 
turbulating satellites which are about to be wiped, 
i hope that the situation gets cleared some way and day, but keep working with it.

concerning revealing identity i have done today 
what was needed to get contacted in a classic way.
I verified myself against a smart contract coming and working with parity
being sms-verified.

the next upcoming quest are to register a certain name with ens and parity-
for that certain experiment i need ether, 
i guess about 0.75 to get the name i want.

very decisive here also is to read the documentation in detail not to waste ether/gas.
decisive as well is the decision which wallet/account i "combine" with which name-auction won.

as the pyramid of trust while pay, hold, own, interact as buy and sell are concerned is not so complex- 
therefore my personal "usage-scheme" has to match to the client i want to use to interact with any chain.
as parity is being tested after 11072017 i can verify for myself with stated proofs and main.chain.logs. that 
"everything looks normal to me" running version 1.8.2.beta- always to be 
found within ethernodes.net with search parameter to get from me while asking in gitter if interested.
