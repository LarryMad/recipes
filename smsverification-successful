hey, some good news on tests of functionality

even sms verification worked fine for me.

within 10 minutes completely documented run-through.

exactly as describe, that is what i like- proof piture being posted as well.

now after 3 days of intensense testing i cannot find other
user-side upcoming question.

concerning revealing identity i have done what was needed to get contacted in a classic way.

the next upcoming quest are to register a certain name with ens and parity-
for that certain experiment i need ether, 
i guess about 0.75 to get the name i want.

very decisive here also is to read the documentation in detail not to waste ether/gas.
decisive as well i the decision which wallet/account i "combine" with which name-auction won.

having a 1:1 relationsship for testing in my mind, i will come up
to test higher levels of relationship (model M-r-r-N->s.e. as i understood it right, 
an account can bid for a specific ether.domain via ens.domains- as a reg entry is won by auction the
winner can set up certain resolving to make it very easy to understand- after 2 years this is gonna be "reauctioned"). 

erst jetzt fällt mir auf, daß ich englisch angefangen habe-
Sonntags... machen wir uns nichts vor, ist manches anders.
