SERVES 6
Ingredients
6 (4–6-oz.) boneless, skinless filets sole
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1⁄2 cup flour
10 tbsp. unsalted butter
3 tbsp. finely chopped parsley
1⁄2 lemon, thinly sliced crosswise
Instructions
Season filets on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour on a plate and set aside. Heat 4 tbsp. butter in a 12" skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, dust filets in flour, shaking off excess, and then place in skillet; cook, turning once, until browned on both sides and just cooked through, about 6 minutes. Transfer filets to warm serving platter or individual plates; sprinkle with parsley.
Wipe skillet clean and return to heat with remaining butter; cook, swirling pan, until butter begins to brown. Add lemon slices, cook until heated through, and then pour evenly over filets. Serve immediately with lemon slices.
