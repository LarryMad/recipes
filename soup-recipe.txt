1 tablespoon olive oil (or another cooking oil such as canola oil or sunflower oil)
1/2 large onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
2 ribs celery, chopped
2 carrots, sliced
2 cups mixed chopped vegetables, your choice (try cauliflower, zucchini, or green beans)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon thyme
1 teaspoon oregano
1 bay leaf

Heat oil in a large soup or stock pot. Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, the carrots, and the celery. Heat, stirring, for 3-4 minutes, until onions are soft. Add the rest of the vegetables and heat for just another minute or two.
Add salt, garlic powder, thyme, and oregano, stirring to coat the vegetables well.
Add bay leaf, water or vegetable broth and bring to a simmer. If using bouillon cubes, add and stir to make sure they dissolve.
Add the tomatoes, stir, and allow your vegetable soup to simmer until all the vegetables are cooked, about 8-12 minutes.
Adjust seasonings to taste.
Remove the bay leaf and serve your homemade vegetable soup with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese if you're not eating vegan, and some crusty bread or crackers.
