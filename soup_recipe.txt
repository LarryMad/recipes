Melt the butter in a saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Stir in the sliced potatoes; cook gently over medium heat for 5 minutes, or until they are slightly cooked and golden in colour.
Add half spoon of salt.
Add 2 spoon of vegetable oil.
Stir in the spinach leaves; pour in the water and add the stock cubes.
Bring to the boil; reduce heat and allow to simmer for 5 - 10 minutes.
Remove from heat. Use a hand held immersion blender to puree the soup.
If you like, you can serve with a swirl of cream and a twist of black pepper.
