Batter:
2 cups of flour
2 cups of water
2 eggs
1 cup of milk
2 tbsp of cooking oil

Toppings:
Sugar
Cinnamon to taste

Method:
1. Add flour to milk and half the water. Whisk until smooth.
2. Add all other ingredients and whisk until smooth.
3. Let the batter stand at least 15 minutes.
4. Heat a non-stick frying pan coated thinly with cooking oil until a droplet of batter sizzles when coming into contact with the surface.
5. Use a soup ladle to scoop batter into pan, tilt pan with batter to and fro so that batter coats the bottom of the pan evenly and thinly. The thinner the better.
6. Wait until the sides start to brown and separate from the pan.
7. Loosen by either sliding a spatula underneath the pan or by holding the panhandle and bumping it with the palm of your other hand.
8. Flip the pancake with a spatula or by throwing it up in the air with a flipping motion.
9. Fry another minute before moving pancake to a plate (optionally heat a big saucepan filled with water so that it is simmering, place plate with finished pancakes on top as a makeshift lid. Cover pancakes. Steam from saucepan will keep pancakes warm.)
10. Serve with cinnamon sugar, ice cream, berries and cream, apple puree and cinnamon or savoury sauces.
