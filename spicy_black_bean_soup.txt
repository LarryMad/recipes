    Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium heat until shimmering. 
    Add the onions, celery and carrot and a light sprinkle of salt. 
    Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetable are soft, about 10 to 15 minutes.
    Stir in the garlic, cumin and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
    Pour in the beans and broth and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. 
    Cook, reducing heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer, until the broth is flavorful and the beans are very tender, about 30 minutes.
    Puree about 4 cups of the soup in a blender until smooth (beware the steam that escapes from the top of the blender, it's very hot). 
    Return the pureed soup to the pot, stir in the cilantro, vinegar/lime juice and salt and pepper, to taste. Serve.
