get steak, lots of marbeling, really thick
light and heat grill to 400+ degress F
rub steak with a salt, pepper, garlic salt mix
put steak on grill for ~3 minutes per side until nicely grilled on outside, but still soft to pressure
Option - rotate steak 90 degrees after one minute on each side to create a grill mark ;)
