Ingredients:
 - 2 (8 ounce) beef rib-eye steaks, cut 3/4 inch thick
 - 1 teaspoon steak seasoning
 - 3 thick slices bacon
 - 2 teaspoons butter
 - 1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
 - 3/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard
 - 1/2 cup thinly sliced red bell pepper
 - 8 ounces small mushrooms, quartered
 - 2 tablespoons crumbled blue cheese
Directions:
 1/ Prepare an outdoor grill using charcoal briquettes stacked 2 to 3 deep. Season the steaks on both sides with steak seasoning.
 2/ While the charcoal heats up, fry the bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels. Leave grease in the pan.
 3/ When the charcoal is covered with gray ashes, put the steaks on the grill. Cook for 12 minutes, turning once, or to your desired degree of doneness.
 4/ While the steaks are cooking, stir the butter, Worcestershire sauce and mustard into the bacon grease. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until butter has melted. Add the red bell pepper and mushrooms; cook and stir until tender.
 5/ To serve, place steaks onto plates. Top with bacon, then blue cheese and then the vegetables. Serve immediately.
