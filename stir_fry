STIR-FRIED RICE WITH ANYTHING

Ingredients:
- Rice that has been sitting in the fridge at least an hour. Left-over from a
day or two prior is best

- Fresh Vegetables, preferably and Onion, carrot, celery, perhaps bell peppers
chopped into bite-sized pieces

- A couple teaspoons sesame oil

- A couple tablespoons peanut or grapeseed oil (or other flavorless oil)

- ginger and garlic, minced

- a few teaspoons soy sauce

- hot pepper flakes if you like

- an egg

Actions:
Heat the oil in a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Once the oil is hot (it
can and should smoke a bit) add the hardest vegetables first (like bell peppers
and carrots). Once those begin to soften, add the onions. When the onions are
soft and starting to brown, add the rice and stir constantly. if the rice starts
sticking to the pan, you're screwed, but add a little more oil anyway just to
minimize the screwing.
When the rice just starts to brown, make a mound of it in the middle of the pan
and then hollow out the middle of the mound so there's a dougnut of stir-fry
in the center of the pan. Drop the egg in the middle of the doughnut, let it
cook for 10 - 20 seconds, then stir it into the rice rapidly. When the egg is
almost dry, add in the garlic and ginger, stir for 30 - 60 seconds, add the
sesame oil and soy sauce, turn off the heat and stir for a few more seconds,
then get it onto a serving dish. Serve.
