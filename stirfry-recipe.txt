Stir Fry Recipe:

Ingredients:

- Three teaspoons Dark Seasame Oil, divided
- 1.2 cup Low-Sodium (Chicken or Beef) broth
- 2 Tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
- 1 Tablespoon Rice vinegar (optional)
- 1 teaspoon Chile Paste
- 2 teaspoon Cornstarch
- Kosher Salt
- Peanut Oil
- 1 pound cubed chicken tenderloin, or 1 pound sliced strips of steak
- Green and/or Orange bell pepper, sliced into strips
- 1 cup diagonally cut snow peas
- 1 small red onion
- 1 tablespoon fresh minced garlic
- 2 cups long grain white or brown rice
- 1/2 cup lightly salted Peanuts, roughly chopped

DIRECTIONS:

- In a small bowl or measuring cup; add two teaspoons of the sesame oil, 1/2 cup (beef or chicken) broth, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 Tablespoon rice vinegar (optional - never done it), 1 teaspoon chile paste, 2 teaspoons cornstarch and a few pinches of salt. Stir to combine.
- In another small bowl combine the chopped peppers, snow peas, onion and garlic
- Heat up your wok over medium-high heat. Add a teaspoon of sesame seed oil plus a tablespoon of peanut oil to the hot wok, swirl the oil to coat. Add in the (chicken or beef) and stir-fry 2-3 minutes. Remove to a small bowl.
- Add remaining tablespoon of peanut oil, swirl and add in the peppers, snow peas, onion, and garlic. Stir-fry the veggies for 1-2 minutes until heated through but still firm.
- Add broth mixture and cook for 30 seconds or until thickened. Add chicken back in to the wok and cook for 4-5 more minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
- Drain about 1/5 (modified by below) of the liquid mixture, and add more corn starch as necessary to thicken the sauce. Add chile paste, sesame oil and soy sauce to taste.
- Add chopped peanuts to garnish

Most recent adjustment notes from ~11/22/14 cook:

- Most needed element was more soy sauce (in Doug’s opinion)
- Competing for most important needed element was better seasoned/marinated beef. We added some salt and pepper in a thin coating to the beef strips
- I bought “stir fry” beef from the store, which wasn’t as good as when I bought thin-sliced steak and cut it into stir fry strips myself. I don’t think it was as tender.
- I think garlic salt and the chile paste should be added to the oil in the earliest steps, before cooking beef or vegetables
- During step 5 I keep removing about half the existing broth mixture, and adding about another teaspoon of corn starch to firm up the sauce. I think I shouldn’t lose as much broth, but I would stick with adding the corn starch later in the cook
