DIRECTIONS

Fill a small bowl with 2 tablespoons of cold water. Sprinkle the gelatin over top and let stand for 5 minutes.
In a small saucepan, combine the strawberries and sugar and cook over medium heat, pressing the fruit with the back of a spoon and stirring frequently, until it has broken down and the juices are syrupy, about 10 minutes. Using an immersion blender, blend the fruit until smooth. (If you do not have an immersion blender, wait for the mixture to cool, then transfer it to a blender and puree.)
Bring the berry puree back to a low simmer, add the gelatin mixture, and stir until completely dissolved. Remove from heat. Add the cream and lemon juice and stir to combine. Divide mixture evenly among six 4 oz. ramekins and cover with plastic wrap. Chill until firm, at least 4 hours or overnight.
Top with fresh berries and serve.
