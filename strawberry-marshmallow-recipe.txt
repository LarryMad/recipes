INGREDIENTS

Vegetable oil or cooking spray, for pan
4 envelopes unflavored gelatin
2 1/2 cups granulated sugar
2/3 cup seedless strawberry jam or jelly
2/3 cup light corn syrup
Dash of salt
Red food coloring
Confectioners' sugar, for dusting

DIRECTIONS

Brush a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with vegetable oil. Line dish with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on 2 sides; oil parchment. Set dish aside.
Pour 2/3 cup cold water into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Sprinkle with gelatin; let stand until softened, 5 minutes.
Stir together granulated sugar, jam, corn syrup, salt, and 1/2 cup water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring often. Continue to boil until syrup registers 238 degrees on a candy thermometer (soft-ball stage).
Add syrup to gelatin. Beat on low speed until slightly cooled. Gradually raise speed to high, beating until mixture is cool and peaks form, 30 to 40 minutes. Mix in red food coloring, one drop at a time, to achieve desired shade of pink.
Pour mixture into prepared pan; smooth surface. Let stand, uncovered, until firm, about 3 hours or overnight.
Dust a cutting board with confectioners' sugar. Run a knife around edges of marshmallow to loosen; unmold onto cutting board. Peel off parchment. Lightly coat a large sharp knife with oil; cut marshmallow into 1 1/2- to 2-inch pieces, coating knife with more oil as necessary. Dust with confectioners' sugar; toss to coat completely.
COOK'S NOTES
