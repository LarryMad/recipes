So here is the secret to make the perfect Swedish vegan pancakes!

Ingredients:

Pancake Batter:

* 600 ml Dairy Free Milk (make sure you use unsweetened milk if you are making savoury pankcakes/ crêpes)
* 1 cup Plain White Flour
* 4 tbs Soy Flour
* 1 pinch of Salt
* 1 tsp Baking Powder
* 4 tbs (or 50 g) Dairy Free Margarine (+ extra for frying the pancakes)

Sweet & savoury filling/ topping suggestions:

* Raspberry or strawberry jam with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream (this is the true Swedish way)
* Fresh squeezed lemon and sugar
* Creamy mushroom, topped with vegan cheese. (baked in the oven until the cheese has melted)
* Creamy “shrimp” or “ham”, topped with vegan cheese. (baked in the oven until the cheese has melted)

Preparation:

1. Melt the margarine and leave it to slightly cool.

2.Mix all the dry ingredients and add half of the milk whisking well, electric beater is recommended.

3.Add the rest of the milk and the melted margarine. Leave the batter for 15-30 minutes, this will allow the batter to slightly thicken before use.

4.Use a small nob of margarine to fry around 100 ml of batter in a non-stick pan (remember add you pancake batter and swosh it around in the pan to spread it thin and evenly). This recipe will make around 10 pancakes.

5. Eat them straight away with your sweet topping of choice or fill them with your favourite savoury filling and roll them up. Sprinkle with vegan cheese and bake in a   390 F oven until the cheese has just melted and turned slightly golden.
