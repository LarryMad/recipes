Recipe for Palak Paneer


Heat water in a large pot.
Clean the spinach and wash it thoroughly under running water.
Once the water comes to a boil, add the cooking soda and spinach and blanch the spinach for 3-4 minutes.
Drain the water and run the spinach under cold water immediately.
Put the spinach a blender along with green chillies and make a smooth paste.
Heat oil in a pan.
Once the oil is hot, add cumin seeds and dried red chillies.
Let them crackle for a few seconds.
Add onion and garlic and fry until onion turns translucent.
Add tomato and cook for 3-4 minutes. You can blend the masala in a blender at this stage for a creamier gravy.

Now add coriander powder, garam masala powder and fry for another minute.

Add spinach puree and saute on high heat for minute.
Add paneer, salt and 1/2 cup water and bring the curry to a boil.
Switch off the heat and add lemon juice and mix well.
For the Dhungar, heat a coal piece until it is red hot. Keep a bowl inside the bowl with curry and keep the piece of coal on top of it. Pour a tsp of ghee on top of the coal and immediately close the lid of the main bowl.
Let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
Open the lid, remove the coal piece and the small bowl and give the curry a gentle mix.
Garnish the Palak Paneer with Fresh Cream.
Serve hot with Naan or Phulke.
