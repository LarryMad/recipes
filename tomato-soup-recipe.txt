1 Cook the onion and garlic: Heat the oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until softened.
2 Add the tomatoes and beans: Add the tomatoes, beans, water, salt, and pepper to the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes, or until the tomatoes are very soft. Stir in the Parmesan.
3 Puree the soup: In 2- to 3-cup batches, puree the soup in a blender until smooth, or use an immersion blender. (Warning! The soup is hot! To puree hot liquid in a blender, only fill it 1/3 full. Cover the lid with a folded dishtowel and hold it down with your hand. Start on low speed, and increase the speed gradually.)
Transfer the soup to a pot and taste. Add salt and pepper, if you like. Reheat over low heat until hot.
4 Make the garnish: In a bowl, stir together the tomatoes, oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Just before serving, stir in the basil
5 Serve the soup: Ladle the soup into bowls, and top each bowl with the fresh tomato garnish.
