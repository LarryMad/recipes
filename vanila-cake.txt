Ingredients
1 cake (510 g) McCain® Deep'n Delicious® Vanilla Cake or Chocolate Cake

8 oz (250 g) white or dark chocolate, melted

3 tbsp (45 mL) round sprinkles  

Directions
Scrape 1/3 of the frosting from the top of the cake. Save for another use.
Crumble cake and remaining frosting into a bowl. Beat with hand mixer on medium speed just until crumbled.
Roll mixture into 1 1/4-inch (3 cm) balls and transfer to parchment lined baking trays.   
Dip the tips of the lollipop sticks into melted white chocolate and insert into each ball.
Place in freezer for 5 mins or until chocolate is set and balls are firm.
Dip cake pops into chocolate, gently shaking off excess. Garnish with sprinkles. Freeze for 5 minutes or until chocolate is set.
TIP:

For adults replace the round sprinkles with toasted desiccated coconut.
Store cake pops in refrigerator until ready to serve.
