Ingredients

    1 tbsp virgin coconut oil
    4 tbsp yellow curry paste
    2 15-ounce cans of coconut milk
    3 cups water
    4 carrots, peeled and sliced into 1/8" rounds
    4 medium-size potatoes, peeled and cut into bite-size pieces
    1 yellow onion, sliced into wedges, then halved
    2 chicken breasts, very thinly sliced
    1 1/2 tsp fish sauce
    3/4 tsp salt
    1 1/2 tsp sugar
    cilantro, for garnish (if desired)
    serve with jasmine rice (if desired)

Instructions

    Bring a pot of salted water to a boil, and boil potatoes until fork-tender. Drain and set aside. 

    Then, in a large pot, heat up coconut oil.

    Add curry paste to oil, and stir for a few minutes.

    Add in coconut milk and water, and stir. Bring to a boil.

    Add in carrots and onions. 

    Once carrots are almost fork-tender, add in very thinly sliced chicken and cook for two or three minutes. Then remove from heat.

    Add in potatoes.

    Stir in fish sauce, salt, and sugar.

    If desired, serve over rice and garnish with cilantro. 

Recipe Notes

    Make sure to purchase this yellow curry paste from Amazon. While you might be able to find other yellow curry pastes at the grocery store, none of them are as authentic as this one, which comes straight from Thailand! 
    If you don't have virgin coconut oil, you can also use vegetable oil. 
    You can make this recipe vegetarian/vegan by simply omitting the chicken and fish sauce. Just make sure to salt the curry accordingly. 
    We used this mandoline, to cut all of the carrots equally, and to give them that fun, ridged texture.
