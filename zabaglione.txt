Ingredients:
 - 2 egg yolks
 - 1 tablespoon caster sugar
 - 1 tablespoon marsala, madeira or sherry 

Directions:
 1. In the top of the double boiler or a metal/heatproof bowl that can be suspended over simmering water, beat the egg yolks and sugar until thick and foamy. Beat in the wine.
 2. Set the mixture over the simmering water. Make sure the water doesn't touch the base of the bowl and whisk constantly for about 4-5 minutes.
 3. Continue whisking until it forms a thick creamy foam that coats the back of the spoon. The eggs need to be cooked gently so the mixture stays smooth.
 4. Serve immediately over fresh fruit, sponge finger biscuits or broken biscotti pieces. It can also be served chilled.
